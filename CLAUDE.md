Project Phoenix: QR-Based Order Workspace System
Version: 2.1
Last Updated: January 13, 2025
Production URL: https://order-management-kappa-seven.vercel.app
Status: Core features complete. Authentication implemented. Test coverage in progress.
1. Core Mission & Purpose
This system is designed to eliminate errors and create a complete digital audit trail for the chemical fulfillment process. It solves two primary business problems:
Preventing Errors: Pumping the wrong chemical, using the wrong grade, or shipping the wrong pre-packaged goods.
Creating Traceability: Moving from a verbal/paper-based system to a fully digital, real-time tracking system for every order and its components.
The core principle is a desktop-first preparation workflow that feeds a mobile-first, foolproof execution workflow on the warehouse floor.
2. System Architecture & Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router) with Turbopack
Authentication: Better Auth v1.3.5 with Drizzle adapter
Deployment: Vercel (Frontend & Serverless Functions), AWS (Services)
Database: PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon) with Drizzle ORM
Backend: Next.js API Routes (app/api), AWS S3, SQS, SNS
AI Services: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Vision, Speech-to-Text, Analysis)
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Language: TypeScript
3. The End-to-End "Golden Path" Workflow
This is the primary user journey, designed to be robust and intuitive.
Order Ingestion (Automated): A ShipStation webhook automatically creates a "Workspace" when an order is tagged for freight processing.
Preparation (Desktop - Supervisor):
A supervisor views the Work Queue Dashboard (/) to see available orders.
They select an order, opening the Order Assignment Modal.
For each line item, they choose a workflow:
Pump & Fill: They are required to assign a specific, QR-coded Source Container from inventory. If the source concentration is higher than the target, a Dilution Calculator is presented.
Direct Resell: The item is marked as ready, requiring no source.
Once all items are assigned, they click "Print All Labels". A PDF with unique, informative 4x6" labels for the Master, Source(s), and Destination containers is generated.
Execution (Mobile - Worker):
A worker takes the printed labels and a mobile device to the floor.
They scan the Master QR to open the Worker View Task List.
The task list is prioritized, showing "Pump & Fill" items first.
The worker selects an item to begin its specific inspection flow.
The app guides them through scanning the correct Source and Destination QRs, ensuring a perfect physical-to-digital match.
If issues arise, they can use the AI Issue Reporter (voice/photo) instead of typing.
Completion: Once all items are inspected, the order's status is updated, and a complete digital audit trail is available in the activity_log.
4. Key Features & Modules
Desktop Supervisor Experience
Work Queue Dashboard (/): Live-updating list of all freight orders from ShipStation.
Order Assignment Modal: The central command center for preparing an order.
Hybrid Workflow Control: Per-item selection of "Pump & Fill" vs. "Direct Resell".
Source Container Selector: A searchable interface to link bulk inventory to order items.
Grade Mismatch Warning: An automated safety check that alerts the supervisor if the source grade (e.g., Tech) is incompatible with the required destination grade (e.g., Food Grade).
Dilution Calculator (/dilution-calculator):
A standalone tool, seamlessly integrated into the assignment workflow.
Uses a database of verified chemical data to calculate precise mixing ratios.
Saves a permanent batch_history record linked to the destination containers.
Generates an elegant, printable PDF worksheet for each batch.
Anomaly Dashboard (/anomaly-dashboard): An AI-powered dashboard that analyzes historical data to find hidden risk patterns and high-risk product/customer combinations.
Mobile Worker Experience
Task List UI: An interactive to-do list for multi-item orders, allowing workers to choose their next task.
Guided Inspection Flow: A step-by-step process with large, high-contrast UI elements.
Integrated QR Scanner: The camera is used to verify source and destination containers at the appropriate steps.
"Auto-Skip" Logic: The app intelligently skips unnecessary steps (like source scanning for "Direct Resell" items) to streamline the process.
Backend & Data Systems
Database Schema (/lib/db/schema): A clean, normalized PostgreSQL schema with tables for workspaces, items, source containers, products, batch history, QR codes, and activity.
On-Demand QR Generation: A robust system that creates and links QR codes for all entities as needed, with a unique, partial index to prevent duplicate source QRs.
Professional PDF Label Generation: A Vercel-compatible service that creates informative 4x6" labels with human-readable data (Order #, Chemical Name, Container #) and instructional badges ("SCAN AT START").
AI Services (/lib/services/ai): A dedicated service layer for all Google Gemini integrations (OCR, Voice-to-Text, Vision Analysis, Pattern Detection).
5. Development & Testing
Database Management (Drizzle Kit)
Generate Migrations: npm run db:migrate
Apply Migrations: npm run db:push
View Database: npm run db:studio
Testing Suite
The project uses a comprehensive testing framework. All tests run against a separate test database defined in .env.test.
End-to-End Tests (Playwright): Located in /tests/e2e/.
simple-workflow.spec.ts: Tests basic navigation and view switching. (All Passing)
full-order-workflow.spec.ts: Simulates the entire "Golden Path" workflow. (WIP - Needs schema alignment)
Unit & Integration Tests (Vitest): To be added for services and API routes.
Run E2E Tests:
code
Bash
# Run all E2E tests headless
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests in UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui
