For each listed material, the Table identifies the hazard class or specifies that the material is forbidden in transportation, and gives the proper shipping name or directs the user to the preferred proper shipping name. In addition, the Table specifies or references requirements in this subchapter pertaining to labeling, packaging, quantity limits aboard aircraft and stowage of hazardous materials aboard vessels. (b) Column 1: Symbols. Column 1 of the Table contains six symbols (“ + ”, “A”, “D”, “G”, “I” and “W”) as follows: (1) The plus (+) sign fixes the proper shipping name, hazard class and packing group for that entry without regard to whether the material meets the definition of that class, packing group or any other hazard class definition. When the plus sign is assigned to a proper shipping name in Column (1) of the § 172.101 Table, it means that the material is known to pose a risk to humans. When a plus sign is assigned to mixtures or solutions containing a material where the hazard to humans is significantly different from that of the pure material or where no hazard to humans is posed, the material may be described using an alternative shipping name that represents the hazards posed by the material. An appropriate alternate proper shipping name and hazard class may be authorized by the Associate Administrator. (2) The letter “A” denotes a material that is subject to the requirements of this subchapter only when offered or intended for transportation by aircraft, unless the material is a hazardous substance or a hazardous waste. A shipping description entry preceded by an “A” may be used to describe a material for other modes of transportation provided all applicable requirements for the entry are met. (3) The letter “D” identifies proper shipping names which are appropriate for describing materials for domestic transportation but may be inappropriate for international transportation under the provisions of international regulations (e.g., IMO, ICAO). An alternate proper shipping name may be selected when either domestic or international transportation is involved. (4) The letter “G” identifies proper shipping names for which one or more technical names of the hazardous material must be entered in parentheses, in association with the basic description. (See § 172.203(k).) (5) The letter “I” identifies proper shipping names which are appropriate for describing materials in international transportation. An alternate proper shipping name may be selected when only domestic transportation is involved. (6) The letter “W” denotes a material that is subject to the requirements of this subchapter only when offered or intended for transportation by vessel, unless the material is a hazardous substance or a hazardous waste. A shipping description entry preceded by a “W” may be used to describe a material for other modes of transportation provided all applicable requirements for the entry are met. (c) Column 2: Hazardous materials descriptions and proper shipping names. Column 2 lists the hazardous materials descriptions and proper shipping names of materials designated as hazardous materials. Modification of a proper shipping name may otherwise be required or authorized by this section. Proper shipping names are limited to those shown in Roman type (not italics). (1) Proper shipping names may be used in the singular or plural and in either capital or lower case letters. Words may be alternatively spelled in the same manner as they appear in the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code. For example “aluminum” may be spelled “aluminium” and “sulfur” may be spelled “sulphur”. However, the word “inflammable” may not be used in place of the word “flammable”. (2) Punctuation marks and words in italics are not part of the proper shipping name, but may be used in addition to the proper shipping name. The word “or” in italics indicates that there is a choice of terms in the sequence that may alternately be used as the proper shipping name or as part of the proper shipping name, as appropriate. For example, for the hazardous materials description “Carbon dioxide, solid or Dry ice” either “Carbon dioxide, solid” or “Dry ice” may be used as the proper shipping name; and for the hazardous materials description “Articles, pressurized pneumatic or hydraulic,” either “Articles, pressurized pneumatic” or “Articles, pressurized hydraulic” may be used as the proper shipping name. (3) The word “poison” or “poisonous” may be used interchangeably with the word “toxic” when only domestic transportation is involved. The abbreviation “n.o.i.” or “n.o.i.b.n.” may be used interchangeably with “n.o.s.”. (4) Except for hazardous wastes, when qualifying words are used as part of the proper shipping name, their sequence in the package markings and shipping paper description is optional. However, the entry in the Table reflects the preferred sequence. (5) When one entry references another entry by use of the word “see”, if both names are in Roman type, either name may be used as the proper shipping name (e.g., Ethyl alcohol, see Ethanol). (6) When a proper shipping name includes a concentration range as part of the shipping description, the actual concentration, if it is within the range stated, may be used in place of the concentration range. For example, an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide containing 30 percent peroxide may be described as “Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solution with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide” or “Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solution with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide. ” Also, the percent sign (%) may be used in place of the word “percent” when words in italics containing the word “percent” are used in addition to the proper shipping name. (7) Use of the prefix “mono” is optional in any shipping name, when appropriate. Thus, Iodine monochloride may be used interchangeably with Iodine chloride. In “Glycerol alpha-monochlorohydrin” the term “mono” is considered a prefix to the term “chlorohydrin” and may be deleted. (8) Use of the word “liquid” or “solid”. The word “liquid” or “solid” may be added to a proper shipping name when a hazardous material specifically listed by name may, due to differing physical states, be a liquid or solid. When the packaging specified in Column 8 is inappropriate for the physical state of the material, the table provided in paragraph (i)(4) of this section should be used to determine the appropriate packaging section. (9) Hazardous wastes. If the word “waste” is not included in the hazardous material description in Column 2 of the Table, the proper shipping name for a hazardous waste (as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter), shall include the word “Waste” preceding the proper shipping name of the material. For example: Waste acetone. (10) Mixtures and solutions. (i) A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more hazard class that is not identified specifically by name, comprised of a single predominant hazardous material identified in the Table by technical name and one or more hazardous and/or non-hazardous material, must be described using the proper shipping name of the hazardous material and the qualifying word “mixture” or “solution”, as appropriate, unless— (A) Except as provided in § 172.101(i)(4) the packaging specified in Column 8 is inappropriate to the physical state of the material; (B) The shipping description indicates that the proper shipping name applies only to the pure or technically pure hazardous material; (C) The hazard class, packing group, or subsidiary hazard of the mixture or solution is different from that specified for the entry; (D) There is a significant change in the measures to be taken in emergencies; (E) The material is identified by special provision in Column 7 of the § 172.101 Table as a material poisonous by inhalation; however, it no longer meets the definition of poisonous by inhalation or it falls within a different hazard zone than that specified in the special provision; or (F) The material can be appropriately described by a shipping name that describes its intended application, such as “Coating solution”, “Extracts, flavoring” or “Compound, cleaning liquid.”. (ii) If one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(10)(i)(A) through (F) of this section is satisfied then the proper shipping name selection process in (c)(12)(ii) must be used. (iii) A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more hazard class that is not identified in the Table specifically by name, comprised of two or more hazardous materials in the same hazard class, must be described using an appropriate shipping description (e.g., “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.”). The name that most appropriately describes the material shall be used; e.g., an alcohol not listed by its technical name in the Table shall be described as “Alcohol, n.o.s.” rather than “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.”. Some mixtures may be more appropriately described according to their application, such as “Coating solution” or “Extracts, flavoring liquid” rather than by an n.o.s. entry. Under the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the technical names of at least two components most predominately contributing to the hazards of the mixture or solution may be required in association with the proper shipping name. (11) Except for a material subject to or prohibited by § 173.21, § 173.54, § 173.56(d), § 173.56(e), § 173.224(c) or § 173.225(b) of this subchapter, a material that is considered to be a hazardous waste or a sample of a material for which the hazard class is uncertain and must be determined by testing may be assigned a tentative proper shipping name, hazard class, identification number and packing group, if applicable, based on the shipper's tentative determination according to: (i) Defining criteria in this subchapter; (ii) The hazard precedence prescribed in § 173.2a of this subchapter; (iii) The shipper's knowledge of the material; (iv) In addition to paragraphs (c)(11)(i) through (iii) of this section, for a sample of a material other than a waste, the following must be met: (A) Except when the word “Sample” already appears in the proper shipping name, the word “Sample” must appear as part of the proper shipping name or in association with the basic description on the shipping paper. (B) When the proper shipping description for a sample is assigned a “G” in Column (1) of the § 172.101 Table, and the primary constituent(s) for which the tentative classification is based are not known, the provisions requiring a technical name for the constituent(s) do not apply; and (C) A sample must be transported in a combination packaging that conforms to the requirements of this subchapter that are applicable to the tentative packing group assigned, and may not exceed a net mass of 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) per package. For the transportation of samples of self-reactive materials, organic peroxides, explosives or lighters, see § 173.224(c)(3), § 173.225(c)(2), § 173.56(d) or § 173.308(b)(2) of this subchapter, respectively. (12) Except when the proper shipping name in the Table is preceded by a plus (+)— (i) If it is specifically determined that a material meets the definition of a hazard class, packing group or hazard zone, other than the class, packing group or hazard zone shown in association with the proper shipping name, or does not meet the defining criteria for a subsidiary hazard shown in Column 6 of the Table, the material shall be described by an appropriate proper shipping name listed in association with the correct hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or subsidiary hazard for the material. (ii) Generic or n.o.s. descriptions. If an appropriate technical name is not shown in the Table, selection of a proper shipping name shall be made from the generic or n.o.s. descriptions corresponding to the specific hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or subsidiary hazard, if any, for the material. The name that most appropriately describes the material shall be used, e.g., an alcohol not listed by its technical name in the Table shall be described as “Alcohol, n.o.s.” rather than “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.” Some mixtures may be more appropriately described according to their application, such as “Coating solution” or “Extracts, liquid, for flavor or aroma,” rather than by an n.o.s. entry, such as “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.” It should be noted, however, that an n.o.s. description as a proper shipping name may not provide sufficient information for shipping papers and package markings. Under the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the technical name of one or more constituents that makes the product a hazardous material may be required in association with the proper shipping name. (iii) Multiple hazard materials. If a material meets the definition of more than one hazard class, and is not identified in the Table specifically by name (e.g., acetyl chloride), the hazard class of the material shall be determined by using the precedence specified in § 173.2a of this subchapter, and an appropriate shipping description (e.g., “Flammable liquid, corrosive n.o.s.”) shall be selected as described in paragraph (c)(12)(ii) of this section. (iv) If it is specifically determined that a material is not a forbidden material and does not meet the definition of any hazard class, the material is not a hazardous material. (13) Self-reactive materials and organic peroxides. A generic proper shipping name for a self-reactive material or an organic peroxide, as listed in Column 2 of the Table, must be selected based on the material's technical name and concentration, in accordance with the provisions of § 173.224 or § 173.225 of this subchapter, respectively. (14) A proper shipping name that describes all isomers of a material may be used to identify any isomer of that material if the isomer meets criteria for the same hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) and packing group, unless the isomer is specifically identified in the Table. (15) Unless a hydrate is specifically listed in the Table, a proper shipping name for the equivalent anhydrous substance may be used, if the hydrate meets the same hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) and packing group. (16) Unless it is already included in the proper shipping name in the § 172.101 Table, the qualifying words “liquid” or “solid” may be added in association with the proper shipping name when a hazardous material specifically listed by name in the § 172.101 Table may, due to the differing physical states of the various isomers of the material, be either a liquid or a solid (for example “Dinitrotoluenes, liquid” and “Dinitrotoluenes, solid”). Use of the words “liquid” or “solid” is subject to the limitations specified for the use of the words “mixture” or “solution” in paragraph (c)(10) of this section. The qualifying word “molten” may be added in association with the proper shipping name when a hazardous material, which is a solid in accordance with the definition in § 171.8 of this subchapter, is offered for transportation in the molten state (for example, “Alkylphenols, solid, n.o.s., molten”). (17) Unless it is already included in the proper shipping name in the § 172.101 Table, the qualifying word “stabilized” may be added in association with the proper shipping name, as appropriate, where without stabilization the substance would be forbidden for transportation according to § 173.21(f) of this subchapter. (d) Column 3: Hazard class or Division. Column 3 contains a designation of the hazard class or division corresponding to each proper shipping name, or the word “Forbidden”. (1) A material for which the entry in this column is “Forbidden” may not be offered for transportation or transported. This prohibition does not apply if the material is diluted, stabilized or incorporated in a device and it is classed in accordance with the definitions of hazardous materials contained in part 173 of this subchapter. (2) When a reevaluation of test data or new data indicates a need to modify the “Forbidden” designation or the hazard class or packing group specified for a material specifically identified in the Table, this data should be submitted to the Associate Administrator. (3) A basic description of each hazard class and the section reference for class definitions appear in § 173.2 of this subchapter. (4) Each reference to a Class 3 material is modified to read “Combustible liquid” when that material is reclassified in accordance with § 173.150(e) or (f) of this subchapter or has a flash point above 60 °C (140 °F) but below 93 °C (200 °F). (e) Column 4: Identification number. Column 4 lists the identification number assigned to each proper shipping name. Those preceded by the letters “UN” are associated with proper shipping names considered appropriate for international transportation as well as domestic transportation. Those preceded by the letters “NA” are associated with proper shipping names not recognized for transportation outside of the United States. Identification numbers in the “NA9000” series are associated with proper shipping names not appropriately covered by international hazardous materials (dangerous goods) transportation standards, or not appropriately addressed by international transportation standards for emergency response information purposes, except for transportation in the United States. Those preceded by the letters “ID” are associated with proper shipping names recognized by the ICAO Technical Instructions (see § 171.7 of this subchapter for availability). (f) Column 5: Packing group. Column 5 specifies one or more packing groups assigned to a material corresponding to the proper shipping name and hazard class for that material. Class 2, Class 7, and Division 6.2 do not have packing groups. Articles in classes other than Class 1 are not assigned to packing groups. For packing purposes, any requirement for a specific packaging performance level is set out in the applicable packing authorizations of part 173. Packing Groups I, II, and III indicate the degree of danger presented by the material is great, medium, or minor, respectively. If more than one packing group is indicated for an entry, the packing group for the hazardous material is determined using the criteria for assignment of packing groups specified in subpart D of part 173. When a reevaluation of test data or new data indicates a need to modify the specified packing group(s), the data should be submitted to the Associate Administrator. Each reference in this column to a material that is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose proper shipping name preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter “A” or “W,” is modified to read “III” on those occasions when the material is offered for transportation or transported by a mode in which its transportation is not otherwise subject to requirements of this subchapter. (g) Column 6: Labels. Column 6 specifies codes which represent the hazard warning labels required for a package filled with a material conforming to the associated hazard class and proper shipping name, unless the package is otherwise excepted from labeling by a provision in subpart E of this part, or part 173 of this subchapter. The first code is indicative of the primary hazard of the material. Additional label codes are indicative of subsidiary hazards. Provisions in § 172.402 may require that a label other than that specified in Column 6 be affixed to the package in addition to that specified in Column 6. No label is required for a material classed as a combustible liquid or for a Class 3 material that is reclassed as a combustible liquid. For “Empty” label requirements, see § 173.428 of this subchapter. The codes contained in Column 6 are defined according to the following table: (h) Column 7: Special provisions. Column 7 specifies codes for special provisions applicable to hazardous materials. When Column 7 refers to a special provision for a hazardous material, the meaning and requirements of that special provision are as set forth in § 172.102 of this subpart. (i) Column 8: Packaging authorizations. Columns 8A, 8B and 8C specify the applicable sections for exceptions, non-bulk packaging requirements and bulk packaging requirements, respectively, in part 173 of this subchapter. Columns 8A, 8B and 8C are completed in a manner which indicates that “§ 173.” precedes the designated numerical entry. For example, the entry “202” in Column 8B associated with the proper shipping name “Gasoline” indicates that for this material conformance to non-bulk packaging requirements prescribed in § 173.202 of this subchapter is required. When packaging requirements are specified, they are in addition to the standard requirements for all packagings prescribed in § 173.24 of this subchapter and any other applicable requirements in subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter. (1) Exceptions. Column 8A contains exceptions from some of the requirements of this subchapter. The referenced exceptions are in addition to those specified in subpart A of part 173 and elsewhere in this subchapter. A “None” in this column means no packaging exceptions are authorized, except as may be provided by special provisions in Column 7. (2) Non-bulk packaging. Column 8B references the section in part 173 of this subchapter which prescribes packaging requirements for non-bulk packagings. A “None” in this column means non-bulk packagings are not authorized, except as may be provided by special provisions in Column 7. Each reference in this column to a material which is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose proper shipping name is preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter “A” or “W”, is modified to include “§ 173.203” or “§ 173.213”, as appropriate for liquids and solids, respectively, on those occasions when the material is offered for transportation or transported by a mode in which its transportation is not otherwise subject to the requirements of this subchapter. (3) Bulk packaging. Column (8C) specifies the section in part 173 of this subchapter that prescribes packaging requirements for bulk packagings, subject to the limitations, requirements, and additional authorizations of Columns (7) and (8B). A “None” in Column (8C) means bulk packagings are not authorized, except as may be provided by special provisions in Column (7) and in packaging authorizations Column (8B). Additional authorizations and limitations for use of UN portable tanks are set forth in Column 7. For each reference in this column to a material that is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose proper shipping name is preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter “A” or “W” and that is offered for transportation or transported by a mode in which its transportation is not otherwise subject to the requirements of this subchapter: (i) The column reference is § 173.240 or § 173.241, as appropriate. (ii) For a solid material, the exception provided in special provision B54 is applicable. (iii) For a Class 9 material, which meets the definition of an elevated temperature material, the column reference is § 173.247. (4) For a hazardous material which is specifically named in the Table and whose packaging sections specify packagings not applicable to the form of the material (e.g., packaging specified is for solid material and the material is being offered for transportation in a liquid form) the following table should be used to determine the appropriate packaging section: (5) Cylinders. For cylinders, both non-bulk and bulk packaging authorizations are set forth in Column (8B). Notwithstanding a designation of “None” in Column (8C), a bulk cylinder may be used when specified through the section reference in Column (8B). (j) Column 9: Quantity limitations. Columns 9A and 9B specify the maximum quantities that may be offered for transportation in one package by passenger-carrying aircraft or passenger-carrying rail car (Column 9A) or by cargo aircraft only (Column 9B), subject to the following: (1) “Forbidden” means the material may not be offered for transportation or transported in the applicable mode of transport. (2) The quantity limitation is “net” except where otherwise specified, such as for “Consumer commodity” which specifies “30 kg gross.” (3) When articles or devices are specifically listed by name, the net quantity limitation applies to the entire article or device (less packaging and packaging materials) rather than only to its hazardous components. (4) A package offered or intended for transportation by aircraft and which is filled with a material forbidden on passenger-carrying aircraft but permitted on cargo aircraft only, or which exceeds the maximum net quantity authorized on passenger-carrying aircraft, shall be labelled with the CARGO AIRCRAFT ONLY label specified in § 172.448 of this part. (5) The total net quantity of hazardous material for an outer non-bulk packaging that contains more than one hazardous material may not exceed the lowest permitted maximum net quantity per package as shown in Column 9A or 9B, as appropriate. If one material is a liquid and one is a solid, the maximum net quantity must be calculated in kilograms. See § 173.24a(c)(1)(iv). (k) Column 10: Vessel stowage requirements. Column 10A [Vessel stowage] specifies the authorized stowage locations on board cargo and passenger vessels. Column 10B [Other provisions] specifies codes for stowage and handling requirements for specific hazardous materials. Hazardous materials offered for transportation as limited quantities are allocated stowage category A and are not subject to the stowage codes assigned by column 10B. The meaning of each code in Column 10B is set forth in § 176.84 of this subchapter. Section 176.63 of this subchapter sets forth the physical requirements for each of the authorized locations listed in Column 10A. (For bulk transportation by vessel, see 46 CFR parts 30 to 40, 70, 98, 148, 151, 153 and 154.) The authorized stowage locations specified in Column 10A are defined as follows: (1) Stowage category “A” means the material may be stowed “on deck” or “under deck” on a cargo vessel or on a passenger vessel. (2) Stowage category “B” means— (i) The material may be stowed “on deck” or “under deck” on a cargo vessel and on a passenger vessel carrying a number of passengers limited to not more than the larger of 25 passengers, or one passenger per each 3 m of overall vessel length; and (ii) “On deck only” on passenger vessels in which the number of passengers specified in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section is exceeded. (3) Stowage category “C” means the material must be stowed “on deck only” on a cargo vessel or on a passenger vessel. (4) Stowage category “D” means the material must be stowed “on deck only” on a cargo vessel or on a passenger vessel carrying a number of passengers limited to not more than the larger of 25 passengers or one passenger per each 3 m of overall vessel length, but the material is prohibited on a passenger vessel in which the limiting number of passengers is exceeded. (5) Stowage category “E” means the material may be stowed “on deck” or “under deck” on a cargo vessel or on a passenger vessel carrying a number of passengers limited to not more than the larger of 25 passengers, or one passenger per each 3 m of overall vessel length, but is prohibited from carriage on a passenger vessel in which the limiting number of passengers is exceeded. (6) Stowage category “01” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) or on a passenger vessel. (7) Stowage category “02” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) or “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” in closed cargo transport units on a passenger vessel. (8) Stowage category “03” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) but the material is prohibited on a passenger vessel. (9) Stowage category “04” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” in closed cargo transports on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) but the material is prohibited on a passenger vessel. (10) Stowage category “05” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) but the material is prohibited on a passenger vessel. (l) Changes to the Table. (1) Unless specifically stated otherwise in a rule document published in the Federal Register amending the Table— (i) Such a change does not apply to the shipment of any package filled prior to the effective date of the amendment; and (ii) Stocks of preprinted shipping papers and package markings may be continued in use, in the manner previously authorized, until depleted or for a one-year period, subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, whichever is less. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any alteration of a shipping description or associated entry which is listed in the § 172.101 Table must receive prior written approval from the Associate Administrator. (3) The proper shipping name of a hazardous material changed in the May 6, 1997 final rule, in effect on October 1, 1997, only by the addition or omission of the word “compressed,” “inhibited,” “liquefied” or “solution” may continue to be used to comply with package marking requirements, until January 1, 2003. 1. This appendix lists materials and their corresponding reportable quantities (RQ's) that are listed or designated as “hazardous substances” under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14) (CERCLA; 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq ). This listing fulfills the requirement of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), that all “hazardous substances,” as defined in 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), be listed and regulated as hazardous materials under 49 U.S.C. 5101-5127. That definition includes substances listed under sections 311(b)(2)(A) and 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A) and 1317(a), section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6921, and section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412. In addition, this list contains materials that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has determined to be hazardous substances in accordance with section 102 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9602. It should be noted that 42 U.S.C. 9656(b) provides that common and contract carriers may be held liable under laws other than CERCLA for the release of a hazardous substance as defined in that Act, during transportation that commenced before the effective date of the listing and regulating of that substance as a hazardous material under 49 U.S.C. 5101-5127. 2. This appendix is divided into two TABLES which are entitled “TABLE 1—HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN RADIONUCLIDES” and “TABLE 2—RADIONUCLIDES.” A material listed in this appendix is regulated as a hazardous material and a hazardous substance under this subchapter if it meets the definition of a hazardous substance in § 171.8 of this subchapter. 3. The procedure for selecting a proper shipping name for a hazardous substance is set forth in § 172.101(c). 4. Column 1 of TABLE 1, entitled “Hazardous substance”, contains the names of those elements and compounds that are hazardous substances. Following the listing of elements and compounds is a listing of waste streams. These waste streams appear on the list in numerical sequence and are referenced by the appropriate “D”, “F”, or “K” numbers. Column 2 of TABLE 1, entitled “Reportable quantity (RQ)”, contains the reportable quantity (RQ), in pounds and kilograms, for each hazardous substance listed in Column 1 of TABLE 1. 5. A series of notes is used throughout TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 to provide additional information concerning certain hazardous substances. These notes are explained at the end of each TABLE. 6. TABLE 2 lists radionuclides that are hazardous substances and their corresponding RQ's. The RQ's in table 2 for radionuclides are expressed in units of curies and terabecquerels, whereas those in table 1 are expressed in units of pounds and kilograms. If a material is listed in both table 1 and table 2, the lower RQ shall apply. Radionuclides are listed in alphabetical order. The RQ's for radionuclides are given in the radiological unit of measure of curie, abbreviated “Ci”, followed, in parentheses, by an equivalent unit measured in terabecquerels, abbreviated “TBq”. 7. For mixtures of radionuclides, the following requirements shall be used in determining if a package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance: (i) if the identity and quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of each radionuclide in a mixture or solution is known, the ratio between the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) and the RQ for the radionuclide must be determined for each radionuclide. A package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance when the sum of the ratios for the radionuclides in the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than one; (ii) if the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture or solution is known but the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) of one or more of the radionuclides is unknown, an RQ of a hazardous substance is present in a package when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than the lowest RQ of any individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution; and (iii) if the identity of one or more radionuclides in a mixture or solution is unknown (or if the identity of a radionuclide by itself is unknown), an RQ of a hazardous substance is present when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) in a package is equal to or greater than either one curie or the lowest RQ of any known individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution, whichever is lower. 1. See § 171.4 of this subchapter for applicability to marine pollutants. This appendix lists potential marine pollutants as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter. 2. Marine pollutants listed in this appendix are not necessarily listed by name in the § 172.101 Table. If a marine pollutant not listed by name or by synonym in the § 172.101 Table meets the definition of any hazard Class 1 through 8, then you must determine the class and division of the material in accordance with § 173.2a of this subchapter. You must also select the most appropriate hazardous material description and proper shipping name. If a marine pollutant not listed by name or by synonym in the § 172.101 Table does not meet the definition of any Class 1 through 8, then you must offer it for transportation under the most appropriate of the following two Class 9 entries: “Environmentally hazardous substances, liquid, n.o.s.,” UN3082, or “Environmentally hazardous substances, solid, n.o.s.” UN3077. 3. This appendix contains two columns. The first column, entitled “S.M.P.” (for severe marine pollutants), identifies whether a material is a severe marine pollutant. If the letters “PP” appear in this column for a material, the material is a severe marine pollutant, otherwise it is not. The second column, entitled “Marine Pollutant” , lists the marine pollutants. 4. If a material is not listed in this appendix and meets the criteria for a marine pollutant as provided in Chapter 2.9 of the IMDG Code, (incorporated by reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), the material may be transported as a marine pollutant in accordance with the applicable requirements of this subchapter. 5. If a material or a solution meeting the definition of a marine pollutant in § 171.8 of this subchapter does not meet the criteria for a marine pollutant as provided in section 2.9.3.3 and 2.9.3.4 of the IMDG Code, (incorporated by reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), it may be excepted from the requirements of this subchapter as a marine pollutant if that exception is approved by the Associate Administrator.

When column 7 of the § 172.101 table refers to a special provision for a hazardous material, the meaning and requirements of that provision are as set forth in this section. When a special provision specifies packaging or packaging requirements— (1) The special provision is in addition to the standard requirements for all packagings prescribed in § 173.24 of this subchapter and any other applicable packaging requirements in subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter; and (2) To the extent a special provision imposes limitations or additional requirements on the packaging provisions set forth in column 8 of the § 172.101 table, packagings must conform to the requirements of the special provision. (b) Description of codes for special provisions. Special provisions contain packaging provisions, prohibitions, exceptions from requirements for particular quantities or forms of materials and requirements or prohibitions applicable to specific modes of transportation, as follows: (1) A code consisting only of numbers (for example, “11”) is multi-modal in application and may apply to bulk and non-bulk packagings. (2) A code containing the letter “A” refers to a special provision which applies only to transportation by aircraft. (3) A code containing the letter “B” refers to a special provision that applies only to bulk packaging requirements. Unless otherwise provided in this subchapter, these special provisions do not apply to UN, IM Specification portable tanks or IBCs. (4) A code containing the letters “IB” or “IP” refers to a special provision that applies only to transportation in IBCs. (5) A code containing the letter “N” refers to a special provision which applies only to non-bulk packaging requirements. (6) A code containing the letter “R” refers to a special provision which applies only to transportation by rail. (7) A code containing the letter “T” refers to a special provision which applies only to transportation in UN or IM Specification portable tanks. (8) A code containing the letters “TP” refers to a portable tank special provision for UN or IM Specification portable tanks that is in addition to those provided by the portable tank instructions or the requirements in part 178 of this subchapter. (9) A code containing the letter “W” refers to a special provision that applies only to transportation by water. (c) Tables of special provisions. The following tables list, and set forth the requirements of, the special provisions referred to in column 7 of the § 172.101 table. (1) Numeric provisions. These provisions are multi-modal and apply to bulk and non-bulk packagings: (2) “A” codes. These provisions apply only to transportation by aircraft: (3) “B” codes. These provisions apply only to bulk packagings. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, these special provisions do not apply to UN portable tanks or IBCs: (4) IB Codes and IP Codes. These provisions apply only to transportation in IBCs and Large Packagings. Table 1 authorizes IBCs for specific proper shipping names through the use of IB Codes assigned in the § 172.101 table of this subchapter. Table 2 defines IP Codes on the use of IBCs that are assigned to specific commodities in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter. Table 3 authorizes Large Packagings for specific proper shipping names through the use of IB Codes assigned in the § 172.101 table of this subchapter. Large Packagings are authorized for the Packing Group III entries of specific proper shipping names when either special provision IB3 or IB8 is assigned to that entry in the § 172.101 Table. When no IB code is assigned in the § 172.101 Table for a specific proper shipping name, or in § 173.185 or § 173.225(e) Organic Peroxide Table for Type F organic peroxides, use of an IBC or Large Packaging for the material may be authorized when approved by the Associate Administrator. The letter “Z” shown in the marking code for composite IBCs must be replaced with a capital code letter designation found in § 178.702(a)(2) of this subchapter to specify the material used for the other packaging. Tables 1, 2, and 3 follow: (5) “N” codes. These provisions apply only to non-bulk packagings: (6) “R” codes. These provisions apply only to transportation by rail. R1 A person who offers for transportation tank cars containing sulfur, molten or residue of sulfur, molten may reference the Sulfur Institute's, “Molten Sulphur Rail Tank Car Guidance document” (see § 171.7 of this subchapter) to identify tank cars that may pose a risk in transportation due to the accumulation of formed, solid sulfur on the outside of the tank. (7) “T” codes. (i) These provisions apply to the transportation of hazardous materials in UN portable tanks. Portable tank instructions specify the requirements applicable to a portable tank when used for the transportation of a specific hazardous material. These requirements must be met in addition to the design and construction specifications in part 178 of this subchapter. Portable tank instructions T1 through T22 specify the applicable minimum test pressure, the minimum shell thickness (in reference steel), bottom opening requirements and pressure relief requirements. Liquefied compressed gases are assigned to portable tank instruction T50. Refrigerated liquefied gases that are authorized to be transported in portable tanks are specified in tank instruction T75. (ii) The following table specifies the portable tank requirements applicable to “T” Codes T1 through T22. Column 1 specifies the “T” Code. Column 2 specifies the minimum test pressure, in bar (1 bar = 14.5 psig), at which the periodic hydrostatic testing required by § 180.605 of this subchapter must be conducted. Column 3 specifies the section reference for minimum shell thickness or, alternatively, the minimum shell thickness value. Column 4 specifies the applicability of § 178.275(g)(3) of this subchapter for the pressure relief devices. When the word “Normal” is indicated, § 178.275(g)(3) of this subchapter does not apply. Column 5 references applicable requirements for bottom openings in part 178 of this subchapter. “Prohibited” means bottom openings are prohibited, and “Prohibited for liquids” means bottom openings are authorized for solid material only. The table follows: (iii) T50 When portable tank instruction T50 is indicated in Column (7) of the § 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table, the applicable liquefied compressed gas and chemical under pressure descriptions are authorized to be transported in portable tanks in accordance with the requirements of § 173.313 of this subchapter. (iv) T75. When portable tank instruction T75 is referenced in Column (7) of the § 172.101 Table, the applicable refrigerated liquefied gases are authorized to be transported in portable tanks in accordance with the requirements of § 178.277 of this subchapter. (v) UN and IM portable tank codes/special provisions. When a specific portable tank instruction is specified by a “T” Code in Column (7) of the § 172.101 Table for a specific hazardous material, a specification portable tank conforming to an alternative tank instruction may be used if: (A) The alternative portable tank has a higher or equivalent test pressure (for example, 4 bar when 2.65 bar is specified); (B) The alternative portable tank has greater or equivalent wall thickness (for example, 10 mm when 6 mm is specified); (C) The alternative portable tank has a pressure relief device as specified in the “T” Code.

For packages required in § 172.402 to bear a FISSILE label, each such label must be completed with the criticality safety index (CSI) assigned in the NRC or DOE package design approval, or in the certificate of approval for special arrangement or the certificate of approval for the package design issued by the Competent Authority for import and export shipments. For overpacks and freight containers required in § 172.402 to bear a FISSILE label, the CSI on the label must be the sum of the CSIs for all of the packages contained in the overpack or freight container. (f) Each package required by this section to be labeled with a RADIOACTIVE label must have two of these labels, affixed to opposite sides of the package. (See § 172.406(e)(3) for freight container label requirements). (g) The following applicable items of information must be entered in the blank spaces on the RADIOACTIVE label by legible printing (manual or mechanical), using a durable weather resistant means of marking: (1) Contents. Except for LSA-1 material, the names of the radionuclides as taken from the listing of radionuclides in § 173.435 of this subchapter (symbols which conform to established radiation protection terminology are authorized, i.e. , 99 Mo, 60 Co, etc.). For mixtures of radionuclides, with consideration of space available on the label, the radionuclides that must be shown must be determined in accordance with § 173.433(g) of this subchapter. For LSA-I material, the term “LSA-I” may be used in place of the names of the radionuclides. (2) Activity. The maximum activity of the radioactive contents in the package during transport must be expressed in appropriate SI units ( e.g., Becquerels (Bq), Terabecquerels (TBq)). The activity may also be stated in appropriate customary units ( e.g., Curies (Ci), milliCuries (mCi), microCuries (uCi)) in parentheses following the SI units. Abbreviations are authorized. Except for plutonium-239 and plutonium-241, the weight in grams or kilograms of fissile radionuclides (or the mass of each fissile nuclide for mixtures when appropriate) may be inserted instead of activity units. For plutonium-239 and plutonium-241, the weight in grams of fissile radionuclides (or the mass of each fissile nuclide for mixtures when appropriate) may be inserted in addition to the activity units. (3) Transport index. (see § 173.403 of this subchapter.) (h) When one or more packages of Class 7 (radioactive) material are placed within an overpack, the overpack must be labeled as prescribed in this section, except as follows: (1) The “contents” entry on the label may state “mixed” in place of the names of the radionuclides unless each inside package contains the same radionuclide(s). (2) The “activity” entry on the label must be determined by adding together the number of becquerels of the Class 7 (radioactive) materials packages contained therein. (3) For an overpack, the transport index (TI) must be determined by adding together the transport indices of the Class 7 (radioactive) materials packages contained therein, except that for a rigid overpack, the transport index (TI) may alternatively be determined by direct measurement as prescribed in § 173.403 of this subchapter under the definition for “transport index,” taken by the person initially offering the packages contained within the overpack for shipment. (4) The category of Class 7 label for the overpack must be determined from the table in § 172.403(c) using the TI derived according to paragraph (h)(3) of this section, and the maximum radiation level on the surface of the overpack. (5) The category of the Class 7 label of the overpack, and not that of any of the packages contained therein, must be used in accordance with Table 1 of § 172.504(e) to determine when the transport vehicle must be placarded. (6) For fissile material, the criticality safety index which must be entered on the overpack FISSILE label is the sum of the criticality safety indices of the individual packages in the overpack, as stated in the certificate of approval for the package design issued by the NRC or the U.S. Competent Authority.

Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each bulk packaging, freight container, unit load device, transport vehicle or rail car containing any quantity of a hazardous material must be placarded on each side and each end with the type of placards specified in tables 1 and 2 of this section and in accordance with other placarding requirements of this subpart, including the specifications for the placards named in the tables and described in detail in §§ 172.519 through 172.560. (b) DANGEROUS placard. A freight container, unit load device, transport vehicle, or rail car which contains non-bulk packages with two or more categories of hazardous materials that require different placards specified in table 2 of paragraph (e) of this section may be placarded with a DANGEROUS placard instead of the separate placarding specified for each of the materials in table 2 of paragraph (e) of this section. However, when 1,000 kg (2,205 pounds) aggregate gross weight or more of one category of material is loaded therein at one loading facility on a freight container, unit load device, transport vehicle, or rail car, the placard specified in table 2 of paragraph (e) of this section for that category must be applied. (c) Exception for less than 454 kg (1,001 pounds). Except for bulk packagings and hazardous materials subject to § 172.505, when hazardous materials covered by table 2 of this section are transported by highway or rail, placards are not required on— (1) A transport vehicle or freight container which contains less than 454 kg (1001 pounds) aggregate gross weight of hazardous materials covered by table 2 of paragraph (e) of this section; or (2) A rail car loaded with transport vehicles or freight containers, none of which is required to be placarded. (d) Exception for empty non-bulk packages. Except for hazardous materials subject to § 172.505, a non-bulk packaging that contains only the residue of a hazardous material covered by Table 2 of paragraph (e) of this section need not be included in determining placarding requirements. (e) Placarding tables. Placards are specified for hazardous materials in accordance with the following tables: (f) Additional placarding exceptions. (1) When more than one division placard is required for Class 1 materials on a transport vehicle, rail car, freight container or unit load device, only the placard representing the lowest division number must be displayed. (2) A FLAMMABLE placard may be used in place of a COMBUSTIBLE placard on— (i) A cargo tank or portable tank. (ii) A compartmented tank car which contains both flammable and combustible liquids. (3) A NON-FLAMMABLE GAS placard is not required on a transport vehicle which contains non-flammable gas if the transport vehicle also contains flammable gas or oxygen and it is placarded with FLAMMABLE GAS or OXYGEN placards, as required. (4) OXIDIZER placards are not required for Division 5.1 materials on freight containers, unit load devices, transport vehicles or rail cars which also contain Division 1.1 or 1.2 materials and which are placarded with EXPLOSIVES 1.1 or 1.2 placards, as required.

(6) The EXPLOSIVE 1.4 placard is not required for those Division 1.4 Compatibility Group S (1.4S) materials that are not required to be labeled 1.4S. (7) For domestic transportation of oxygen, compressed or oxygen, refrigerated liquid, the OXYGEN placard in § 172.530 of this subpart may be used in place of a NON-FLAMMABLE GAS placard. (8) For domestic transportation, a POISON INHALATION HAZARD placard is not required on a transport vehicle or freight container that is already placarded with the POISON GAS placard. (9) For Class 9, a CLASS 9 placard is not required for domestic transportation, including that portion of international transportation, defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter, which occurs within the United States. However, a bulk packaging must be marked with the appropriate identification number on a CLASS 9 placard, an orange panel, or a white square-on-point display configuration as required by subpart D of this part. (10) For Division 6.1, PG III materials, a POISON placard may be modified to display the text “PG III” below the mid line of the placard. (11) For domestic transportation, a POISON placard is not required on a transport vehicle or freight container required to display a POISON INHALATION HAZARD or POISON GAS placard. (g) For shipments of Class 1 (explosive materials) by aircraft or vessel, the applicable compatibility group letter must be displayed on the placards, or labels when applicable, required by this section. When more than one compatibility group placard is required for Class 1 materials, only one placard is required to be displayed, as provided in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section. For the purposes of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4), there is a distinction between the phrases explosive articles and explosive substances. Explosive article means an article containing an explosive substance; examples include a detonator, flare, primer or fuse. Explosive substance means a substance contained in a packaging that is not contained in an article; examples include black powder and smokeless powder. (1) Explosive articles of compatibility groups C, D or E may be placarded displaying compatibility group E.

This term does not include an offeror's facility, private track, private siding, or consignee's facility. (2) In performing the analysis required by this paragraph, the rail carrier must seek relevant information from state, local, and tribal officials, as appropriate, regarding security risks to high-consequence targets along or in proximity to the route(s) utilized. If a rail carrier is unable to acquire relevant information from state, local, or tribal officials, then it must document that in its analysis. For purposes of this section, a high-consequence target means a property, natural resource, location, area, or other target designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security that is a viable terrorist target of national significance, the attack of which by railroad could result in catastrophic loss of life, significant damage to national security or defense capabilities, or national economic harm. (d) Alternative route analysis. (1) For each calendar year, a rail carrier must identify practicable alternative routes over which it has authority to operate, if an alternative exists, as an alternative route for each of the transportation routes analyzed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The carrier must perform a safety and security risk assessment of the alternative routes for comparison to the route analysis prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. The alternative route analysis must be in writing and include the criteria in appendix D of this part. When determining practicable alternative routes, the rail carrier must consider the use of interchange agreements with other rail carriers. The written alternative route analysis must also consider: (i) Safety and security risks presented by use of the alternative route(s); (ii) Comparison of the safety and security risks of the alternative(s) to the primary rail transportation route, including the risk of a catastrophic release from a shipment traveling along each route; (iii) Any remediation or mitigation measures implemented on the primary or alternative route(s); and (iv) Potential economic effects of using the alternative route(s), including but not limited to the economics of the commodity, route, and customer relationship. (2) In performing the analysis required by this paragraph, the rail carrier should seek relevant information from state, local, and tribal officials, as appropriate, regarding security risks to high-consequence targets along or in proximity to the alternative routes. If a rail carrier determines that it is not appropriate to seek such relevant information, then it must explain its reasoning for that determination in its analysis. (e) Route Selection. A carrier must use the analysis performed as required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to select the route to be used in moving the materials covered by paragraph (a) of this section. The carrier must consider any remediation measures implemented on a route. Using this process, the carrier must at least annually review and select the practicable route posing the least overall safety and security risk. The rail carrier must retain in writing all route review and selection decision documentation and restrict the distribution, disclosure, and availability of information contained in the route analysis to covered persons with a need-to-know, as described in parts 15 and 1520 of this title. This documentation should include, but is not limited to, comparative analyses, charts, graphics or rail system maps. (f) Completion of route analysis. (1) The rail transportation route analysis, alternative route analysis, and route selection process required under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section must be completed no later than the end of the calendar year following the year to which the analyses apply. (2) The initial analysis and route selection determinations required under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section must include a comprehensive review of the entire system. Subsequent analyses and route selection determinations required under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section must include a comprehensive, system-wide review of all operational changes, infrastructure modifications, traffic adjustments, changes in the nature of high-consequence targets located along, or in proximity to, the route, and any other changes affecting the safety or security of the movements of the materials specified in paragraph (a) of this section that were implemented during the calendar year. (3) A rail carrier need not perform a rail transportation route analysis, alternative route analysis, or route selection process for any hazardous material other than the materials specified in paragraph (a) of this section. (g) Rail carrier point of contact on routing issues. Each rail carrier must identify a point of contact (including the name, title, phone number and e-mail address) on routing issues involving the movement of materials covered by this section in its security plan and provide this information to: (1) State and/or regional Fusion Centers that have been established to coordinate with state, local and tribal officials on security issues and which are located within the area encompassed by the rail carrier's rail system; and (2) State, local, and tribal officials in jurisdictions that may be affected by a rail carrier's routing decisions and who directly contact the railroad to discuss routing decisions. (h) Storage, delays in transit, and notification. With respect to the materials specified in paragraph (a) of this section, each rail carrier must ensure the safety and security plan it develops and implements under this subpart includes all of the following: (1) A procedure under which the rail carrier must consult with offerors and consignees in order to develop measures for minimizing, to the extent practicable, the duration of any storage of the material incidental to movement (see § 171.8 of this subchapter). (2) Measures to prevent unauthorized access to the materials during storage or delays in transit. (3) Measures to mitigate risk to population centers associated with in-transit storage. (4) Measures to be taken in the event of an escalating threat level for materials stored in transit. (5) Procedures for notifying the consignee in the event of a significant delay during transportation; such notification must be completed within 48 hours after the carrier has identified the delay and must include a revised delivery schedule. A significant delay is one that compromises the safety or security of the hazardous material or delays the shipment beyond its normal expected or planned shipping time. Notification should be made by a method acceptable to both the rail carrier and consignee. (i) Recordkeeping. (1) Each rail carrier must maintain a copy of the information specified in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section (or an electronic image thereof) that is accessible at, or through, its principal place of business and must make the record available upon request, at a reasonable time and location, to an authorized official of the Department of Transportation or the Department of Homeland Security. Records must be retained for a minimum of two years. (2) Each rail carrier must restrict the distribution, disclosure, and availability of information collected or developed in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section to covered persons with a need-to-know, as described in parts 15 and 1520 of this title. (j) Compliance and enforcement. If the carrier's route selection documentation and underlying analyses are found to be deficient, the carrier may be required to revise the analyses or make changes in route selection. If DOT finds that a chosen route is not the safest and most secure practicable route available, the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety, in consultation with TSA, may require the use of an alternative route. Prior to making such a determination, FRA and TSA will consult with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) regarding whether the contemplated alternative route(s) would be economically practicable."},{"part":"172","section":"172.822","subject":"Limitation on actions by states, local governments, and Indian tribes.","type":"table","fullText":"A law, order, or other directive of a state, political subdivision of a state, or an Indian tribe that designates, limits, or prohibits the use of a rail line (other than a rail line owned by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an Indian tribe) for the transportation of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, the materials specified in § 172.820(a), is preempted. 49 U.S.C. 5125, 20106."},{"part":"173","section":"173.1","subject":"Purpose and scope.","type":"regulations","fullText":"(a) This part includes: (1) Definitions of hazardous materials for transportation purposes; (2) Requirements to be observed in preparing hazardous materials for shipment by air, highway, rail, or water, or any combination thereof; and (3) Inspection, testing, and retesting responsibilities for persons who retest, recondition, maintain, repair and rebuild containers used or intended for use in the transportation of hazardous materials.

(ii) Each plastic packaging or receptacle which is used for liquid hazardous materials must be capable of withstanding without failure the procedure specified in appendix B of this part (“Procedure for Testing Chemical Compatibility and Rate of Permeation in Plastic Packagings and Receptacles”). The procedure specified in appendix B of this part must be performed on each plastic packaging or receptacle used for Packing Group I materials. The maximum rate of permeation of hazardous lading through or into the plastic packaging or receptacles may not exceed 0.5 percent for materials meeting the definition of a Division 6.1 material according to § 173.132 and 2.0 percent for other hazardous materials, when subjected to a temperature no lower than— (A) 18 °C (64 °F) for 180 days in accordance with Test Method 1 in appendix B of this part; (B) 50 °C (122 °F) for 28 days in accordance with Test Method 2 in appendix B of this part; or (C) 60 °C (140 °F) for 14 days in accordance with Test Method 3 in appendix B of this part. (iii) Alternative procedures or rates of permeation are permitted if they yield a level of safety equivalent to or greater than that provided by paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section and are specifically approved by the Associate Administrator. (4) Mixed contents. Hazardous materials may not be packed or mixed together in the same outer packaging with other hazardous or nonhazardous materials if such materials are capable of reacting dangerously with each other and causing— (i) Combustion or dangerous evolution of heat; (ii) Evolution of flammable, poisonous, or asphyxiant gases; or (iii) Formation of unstable or corrosive materials. (5) Packagings used for solids, which may become liquid at temperatures likely to be encountered during transportation, must be capable of containing the hazardous material in the liquid state. (f) Closures. (1) Closures on packagings shall be so designed and closed that under conditions (including the effects of temperature, pressure and vibration) normally incident to transportation— (i) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, there is no identifiable release of hazardous materials to the environment from the opening to which the closure is applied; and (ii) The closure is leakproof and secured against loosening. For air transport, stoppers, corks or other such friction closures must be held in place by positive means. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, a closure (including gaskets or other closure components, if any) used on a specification packaging must conform to all applicable requirements of the specification and must be closed in accordance with information, as applicable, provided by the manufacturer's notification required by § 178.2 of this subchapter. (g) Venting. Venting of packagings, to reduce internal pressure which may develop by the evolution of gas from the contents, is permitted only when— (1) Except for shipments of cryogenic liquids as specified in § 173.320(c) and of carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice), transportation by aircraft is not involved; (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the evolved gases are not poisonous, likely to create a flammable mixture with air or be an asphyxiant under normal conditions of transportation; (3) The packaging is designed so as to preclude an unintentional release of hazardous materials from the receptacle; (4) For bulk packagings, other than IBCs, venting is authorized for the specific hazardous material by a special provision in the § 172.101 table or by the applicable bulk packaging specification in part 178 of this subchapter; and (5) Intermediate bulk packagings (IBCs) may be vented when required to reduce internal pressure that may develop by the evolution of gas subject to the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(3) of this section. The IBC must be of a type that has successfully passed (with the vent in place) the applicable design qualification tests with no release of hazardous material. (h) Outage and filling limits —(1) General. When filling packagings and receptacles for liquids, sufficient ullage (outage) must be left to ensure that neither leakage nor permanent distortion of the packaging or receptacle will occur as a result of an expansion of the liquid caused by temperatures likely to be encountered during transportation. Requirements for outage and filling limits for non-bulk and bulk packagings are specified in §§ 173.24a(d) and 173.24b(a), respectively. (2) Compressed gases and cryogenic liquids. Filling limits for compressed gases and cryogenic liquids are specified in §§ 173.301 through 173.306 for cylinders and §§ 173.314 through 173.319 for bulk packagings. (i) Air transportation.

Except for materials not subject to performance packaging requirements in subpart E of this part, a packaging containing a Packing Group III material with a primary or subsidiary risk of Division 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, or Class 8 must meet the Packing Group II performance level when offered for transportation by aircraft. (b) Packages authorized onboard aircraft. (1) When Column 9a of the § 172.101 table indicates that a material is “Forbidden”, that material may not be offered for transportation or transported aboard passenger-carrying aircraft. (2) When Column 9b of the § 172.101 table indicates that a material is “Forbidden”, that material may not be offered for transportation or transported aboard aircraft. (3) The maximum quantity of hazardous material in a package that may be offered for transportation or transported aboard a passenger-carrying aircraft or cargo aircraft may not exceed that quantity prescribed for the material in Column 9a or 9b, respectively, of the § 172.101 table. (4) A package containing a hazardous material which is authorized aboard cargo aircraft but not aboard passenger aircraft must be labeled with the CARGO AIRCRAFT ONLY label required by § 172.402(c) of this subchapter and may not be offered for transportation or transported aboard passenger-carrying aircraft. (c) Pressure requirements. (1) Packagings must be designed and constructed to prevent leakage that may be caused by changes in altitude and temperature during transportation aboard aircraft. (2) Except for packagings used for material transported as “UN3082, Environmentally hazardous substance, liquid, n.o.s.,” packagings for which retention of liquid is a basic function must be capable of withstanding without leakage the greater of— (i) An internal pressure which produces a gauge pressure of not less than 75 kPa (11 psig) for liquids in Packing Group III of Class 3 or Division 6.1; or 95 kPa (14 psig) for other liquids; or (ii) A pressure related to the vapor pressure of the liquid to be conveyed, determined by one of the following: (A) The total gauge pressure measured in the receptacle (i.e., the vapor pressure of the material and the partial pressure of air or other inert gases, less 100 kPa (15 psia)) at 55 °C (131 °F), multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5; determined on the basis of a filling temperature of 15 °C (59 °F) and a degree of filling such that the receptacle is not completely liquid full at a temperature of 55 °C (131 °F) or less; (B) 1.75 times the vapor pressure at 50 °C (122 °F) less 100 kPa (15 psia); or (C) 1.5 times the vapor pressure at 55 °C (131 °) less 100 kPa (15 psia). (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section— (i) Hazardous materials may be contained in an inner packaging which does not itself meet the pressure requirement provided that the inner packaging is packed within a supplementary packaging which does meet the pressure requirement and other applicable packaging requirements of this subchapter. (ii) Packagings which are subject to the hydrostatic pressure test and marking requirements of §§ 178.605 and 178.503(a)(5), respectively, of this subchapter must have a marked test pressure of not less than 250 kPa (36 psig) for liquids in Packing Group I, 80 kPa (12 psig) for liquids in Packing Group III of Class 3 or Division 6.1, and 100 kPa (15 psig) for other liquids. (d) Closures. The body and closure of any packaging must be constructed to be able to adequately resist the effects of temperature and vibration occurring in conditions normally incident to air transportation. Inner packaging or receptacle closures of combination packages containing liquids must be held securely, tightly and effectively in place by secondary means. Examples of such secondary methods include: Adhesive tape, friction sleeves, welding or soldering, locking wires, locking rings, induction heat seals, and child-resistant closures. The closure device must be designed so that it is unlikely that it can be incorrectly or incompletely closed. Closures must be as follows: (1) Packing Group I. An inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Group I must have a secondary means of closure applied and packed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. (2) Packing Groups II and III. When a secondary means of closure cannot be applied or is impracticable to apply to an inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Groups II and III, this requirement may be satisfied by securely closing the inner packaging and placing it in a leakproof liner or bag before placing the inner packaging in its outer packaging. (e) Absorbent materials. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, Packing Group I liquid hazardous materials of Classes 3, 4, or 8, or Divisions 5.1 or 6.1 that are packaged in combination packagings and offered for air transport in glass, earthenware, plastic, or metal inner packagings must be packed using absorbent material as follows: (1) Inner packagings must be packed in a rigid and leakproof receptacle or intermediate packaging containing sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of the inner packaging before packing the inner packaging in its outer package. (2) Absorbent material must not react dangerously with the liquid (see §§ 173.24 and 173.24a.). (f) Combination packagings. Unless otherwise specified in this part, or in subpart C of part 171 of this subchapter, when combination packagings are intended for transportation aboard an aircraft, inner packagings must conform to the quantity limitations set forth in Table 1 of this paragraph for transport aboard passenger-carrying aircraft and Table 2 of this paragraph for transport aboard cargo-only aircraft. For materials that are authorized to exceed 220 L (58 gallons) or 200 kg (441 pounds) in accordance with columns (9A) and (9B) of the § 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table, there is no limitation on the maximum authorized net capacity of each inner packaging. (1) Excepted quantities. For authorized materials and inner and outer package quantity limits for combination packages of excepted quantities intended for transportation by aircraft, see § 173.4a of this part. (2) Limited quantities. (i) Unless otherwise specified in this part, or in subpart C of part 171 of this subchapter, when a limited quantity of hazardous material packaged in a combination packaging is intended for transportation aboard an aircraft, the inner and outer packagings must conform to the quantity limitations set forth in Table 3 of this paragraph (f). Materials and articles must be authorized for transportation aboard a passenger-carrying aircraft (see Column (9A) of the § 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table of this subchapter). Not all unauthorized materials or articles may be indicated in this table. For mixed content packages of limited quantity material, the total net quantity must not exceed the lowest permitted maximum net quantity (for each of the hazard classes or divisions represented in the package) per outer package set forth in Table 3 of this paragraph (f). The permitted maximum net quantity must be calculated in kilograms for a package that contains both a solid and a liquid. Unless otherwise excepted, packages must be marked and labeled in accordance with this section and any additional requirements in subparts D and E, respectively, of part 172 of this subchapter. Materials or articles not authorized as limited quantity by aircraft are: (A) Those in Packing Group I; (B) Class 1 (explosive) material (see § 173.63(b) of this part for exceptions provided to certain articles of Division 1.4S) and Class 7 (radioactive) material (see §§ 173.421 through 173.425 of this part, as applicable, for exceptions provided to certain substances, instruments or articles of Class 7); (C) Divisions 2.1 (flammable gas) ( except Aerosols (UN1950) and Receptacles, small (UN2037) without subsidiary risk) and Division 2.3 (toxic gas); (D) Divisions 4.1 (self-reactive and UN2555, UN2556, UN2557, or UN2907), 4.2 (spontaneously combustible) (primary or subsidiary risk), and 4.3 (dangerous when wet) (liquids); (E) Division 5.2 (organic peroxide) ( except when contained in a Chemical or First aid kit (UN3316) or Polyester resin kit (UN3269) (Types D, E and F non-temperature controlled only)); (F) Class 8 (corrosive) materials UN2794, UN2795, UN2803, UN2809, UN3028, UN3506; and (G) All Class 9 (miscellaneous) materials except for UN1941, UN1990, UN2071, UN3077, UN3082, UN3316, UN3334, UN3335, and ID8000. (ii) Packages must be marked with the limited quantity “Y” mark as prescribed in § 172.315 of this subchapter when conforming to Table 3 of this paragraph. (iii) Strong outer packagings are required and a completed package may not exceed 30 kg (66 lbs) gross weight. (iv) A secondary means of closure required for all liquids contained in inner packagings. If this requirement cannot be satisfied, the use of an intermediate and leakproof form of containment, such as a liner, is required. (v) Packages must be capable of passing a 1.2 m drop test on to a rigid, non-resilient, flat and horizontal surface, in the position most likely to cause damage. The criteria for passing the test is that the outer packaging must not exhibit any damage affecting safety in transport and there must be no leakage from the inner packagings. (vi) Each package must be capable of withstanding, without breakage or leakage of any inner packaging, a force applied to the top surface for a duration of 24 hours equivalent to the total weight of identical packages if stacked to a height of 3 m (including the test sample). (vii) Except for UN3082, inner packagings of combination packagings containing liquids must be capable of passing the appropriate pressure differential test prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. (3) The tables are as follows: (g) Cylinders. For any cylinder containing hazardous materials and incorporating valves, sufficient protection must be provided to prevent operation of, and damage to, the valves during transportation, by one of the following methods: (1) By equipping each cylinder with securely attached valve caps or protective headrings; or (2) By boxing or crating the cylinder. (h) Tank cars and cargo tanks. Any tank car or cargo tank containing a hazardous material may not be transported aboard aircraft. (i) Each person who offers a hazardous material for transportation by aircraft must include the certification statement specified in § 172.204(c)(3) of this subchapter.

Packagings and receptacles used more than once must be in such condition, including closure devices and cushioning materials, that they conform in all respects to the prescribed requirements of this subchapter. Before reuse, each packaging must be inspected and may not be reused unless free from incompatible residue, rupture, or other damage which reduces its structural integrity. Packagings not meeting the minimum thickness requirements prescribed in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be reused or reconditioned for reuse. (b) Reuse of non-bulk packaging. A non-bulk packaging used more than once must conform to the following provisions and limitations: (1) A non-bulk packaging which, upon inspection, shows evidence of a reduction in integrity may not be reused unless it is reconditioned in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. (2) Before reuse, packagings subject to the leakproofness test with air prescribed in § 178.604 of this subchapter shall be— (i) Retested without failure in accordance with § 178.604 of this subchapter using an internal air pressure (gauge) of at least 48 kPa (7.0 psig) for Packing Group I and 20 kPa (3.0 psig) for Packing Group II and Packing Group III; and (ii) Marked with the letter “L”, with the name and address or symbol of the person conducting the test, and the last two digits of the year the test was conducted. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator. (3) Packagings made of paper (other than fiberboard), plastic film, or textile are not authorized for reuse; (4) Metal and plastic drums and jerricans used as single packagings or the outer packagings of composite packagings are authorized for reuse only when they are marked in a permanent manner (e.g., embossed) in mm with the nominal (for metal packagings) or minimum (for plastic packagings) thickness of the packaging material, as required by § 178.503(a)(9) of this subchapter, and— (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, conform to the following minimum thickness criteria: 1 Metal drums or jerricans with a minimum thickness of 0.82 mm body and 1.09 mm heads which are manufactured and marked prior to January 1, 1997 may be reused. Metal drums or jerricans manufactured and marked on or after January 1, 1997, and intended for reuse, must be constructed with a minimum thickness of 0.82 mm body and 1.11 mm heads. (ii) For stainless steel drums and jerricans, conform to a minimum wall thickness as determined by the following equivalence formula: (5) Plastic inner receptacles of composite packagings must have a minimum thickness of 1.0 mm (0.039 inch). (6) A previously used non-bulk packaging may be reused for the shipment of hazardous waste, not subject to the reconditioning and reuse provisions of this section, in accordance with § 173.12(c). (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a packaging otherwise authorized for reuse may be reused without being leakproofness tested with air provided the packaging— (i) Is refilled with a material which is compatible with the previous lading: (ii) Is refilled and offered for transportation by the original filler; (iii) Is transported in a transport vehicle or freight container under the exclusive use of the refiller of the packaging; and (iv) Is constructed of— (A) Stainless steel, monel or nickel with a thickness not less than one and one-half times the minimum thickness prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; (B) Plastic, provided the packaging is not refilled for reuse on a date more than five years from the date of manufacture marked on the packaging in accordance with § 178.503(a)(6) of this subchapter; or (C) Another material or thickness when approved under the conditions established by the Associate Administrator for reuse without retesting. (c) Reconditioning of non-bulk packaging. (1) For the purpose of this subchapter, reconditioning of metal drums is: (i) Cleaning to base material of construction, with all former contents, internal and external corrosion removed, and any external coatings and labels sufficiently removed to expose any metal deterioration that adversely affects transportation safety; (ii) Restoring to original shape and contour, with chimes (if any) straightened and sealed, and all non-integral gaskets replaced: and (iii) Inspecting after cleaning but before painting, Packagings that have visible pitting, significant reduction in material thickness, metal fatigue, damaged threads or closures, or other significant defects, must be rejected. (2) For the purpose of this subchapter, reconditioning of a non-bulk packaging other than a metal drum includes: (i) Removal of all former contents, external coatings and labels, and cleaning to the original materials of construction; (ii) Inspection after cleaning with rejection of packagings with visible damage such as tears, creases or cracks, or damaged threads or closures, or other significant defects; (iii) Replacement of all non-integral gaskets and closure devices with new or refurbished parts, and cushioning and cushioning materials; and components including gaskets, closure devices and cushioning and cushioning material. (For a UN 1H1 plastic drum, replacing a removable gasket or closure device with another of the same design and material that provides equivalent performance does not constitute reconditioning); and (iv) Ensuring that the packagings are restored to a condition that conforms in all respects with the prescribed requirements of this subchapter. (3) A person who reconditions a packaging manufactured and marked under the provisions of subpart L of part 178 of this subchapter, shall mark that packaging as required by § 178.503(c) and (d) of this subchapter. The marking is the certification of the reconditioner that the packaging conforms to the standard for which it is marked and that all functions performed by the reconditioner which are prescribed by this subchapter have been performed in compliance with this subchapter. (4) The markings applied by the reconditioner may be different from those applied by the manufacturer at the time of original manufacture, but may not identify a greater performance capability than that for which the original design type had been tested (for example, the reconditioner may mark a drum which was originally marked as 1A1/Y1.8 as 1A1/Y1.2 or 1A1/Z2.0). (5) Packagings which have significant defects which cannot be repaired may not be reused. (d) Remanufacture of non-bulk packagings. For the purpose of this subchapter, remanufacture is the conversion of a non-specification, non-bulk packaging to a DOT specification or U.N. standard, the conversion of a packaging meeting one specification or standard to another specification or standard (for example, conversion of 1A1 non-removable head drums to 1A2 removable head drums) or the replacement of integral structural packaging components (such as non-removable heads on drums). A person who remanufactures a non-bulk packaging to conform to a specification or standard in part 178 of this subchapter is subject to the requirements of part 178 of this subchapter as a manufacturer. (e) Non-reusable containers. A packaging marked as NRC according to the DOT specification or UN standard requirements of part 178 of this subchapter may be reused for the shipment of any material not required by this subchapter to be shipped in a DOT specification or UN standard packaging. (f) A Division 6.2 packaging to be reused must be disinfected prior to reuse by any means effective for neutralizing the infectious substance the packaging previously contained. A secondary packaging or outer packaging conforming to the requirements of § 173.196 or § 173.199 need not be disinfected prior to reuse if no leakage from the primary receptacle has occurred. Drums or jerricans not meeting the minimum thickness requirements prescribed in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be reused or reconditioned for reuse.

(d) Examination before shipping. (1) No person may offer for transportation a tank car containing a hazardous material or a residue of a hazardous material unless that person determines that the tank car is in proper condition and safe for transportation. As a minimum, each person offering a tank car for transportation must perform an external visual inspection that includes: (i) Except where insulation or a thermal protection system precludes an inspection, the tank shell and heads for abrasion, corrosion, cracks, dents, distortions, defects in welds, or any other condition that makes the tank car unsafe for transportation; (ii) The piping, valves, fittings, and gaskets for corrosion, damage, or any other condition that makes the tank car unsafe for transportation; (iii) For missing or loose bolts, nuts, or elements that make the tank car unsafe for transportation; (iv) All closures on tank cars and determine that the closures and all fastenings securing them are properly tightened in place by the use of a bar, wrench, or other suitable tool; (v) Protective housings for proper securement; (vi) The pressure relief device, including a careful inspection of the rupture disc in non-reclosing pressure relief devices, for corrosion or damage that may alter the intended operation of the device. The rupture disc is not required to be removed prior to visual inspection if the tank car contains the residue, as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter, of a Class 8, PG II or PG III material with no subsidiary hazard or the residue of a Class 9 elevated temperature material; (vii) Each tell-tale indicator after filling and prior to transportation to ensure the integrity of the rupture disc; (viii) The external thermal protection system, tank-head puncture resistance system, coupler vertical restraint system, and bottom discontinuity protection for conditions that make the tank car unsafe for transportation; (ix) The required markings on the tank car for legibility; and (x) The periodic inspection date markings to ensure that the inspection and test intervals are within the prescribed intervals. (2) Closures on tank cars are required, in accordance with this subchapter, to be designed and closed so that under conditions normally incident to transportation, including the effects of temperature and vibration, there will be no identifiable release of a hazardous material to the environment. ln any action brought to enforce this section, the lack of securement of any closure to a tool-tight condition, detected at any point, will establish a rebuttable presumption that a proper inspection was not performed by the offeror of the car. That presumption may be rebutted by any evidence indicating that the lack of securement resulted from a specific cause not within the control of the offeror. (e) Special requirements for poisonous by inhalation (PIH) material —(1) Interior heater coils. Tank cars used for PIH material may not have interior heater coils. (2) Tank car specifications. A tank car used for a PIH material must have a tank test pressure of 20.7 Bar (300 psig) or greater, head protection, and a metal jacket ( e.g., DOT 105S300W), except that— (i) A higher test pressure is required if otherwise specified in this subchapter; and (ii) Each tank car constructed on or after March 16, 2009, and used for the transportation of PIH materials must meet the applicable authorized tank car specifications and standards listed in §§ 173.244(a)(2) or (3) and 173.314(c) or (d). (iii) A tank car owner retiring or otherwise removing a tank car from service transporting PIH material, other than because of damage to the car, must retire or remove cars constructed of non-normalized steel in the head or shell before removing any car in service transporting PIH materials constructed of normalized steel meeting the applicable DOT specification. (3) Phase-out of non-normalized steel tank cars. After December 31, 2020, tank cars manufactured with non-normalized steel for head or shell construction may not be used for the transportation of PIH material. (4) Phase-out of legacy tank cars. After December 31, 2027, tank cars not meeting the requirements of §§ 173.244(a)(2) or (3) and 173.314(c) or (d) may not be used for the transportation of PIH material. (f) Special requirements for hazardous substances. (1) A tank car used for a hazardous substance listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section must have a tank test pressure of at least 13.8 Bar (200 psig), head protection and a metal jacket, except that— (i) No metal jacket is required if— (A) The tank test pressure is 23.4 Bar (340 psig) or higher; or (B) The tank shell and heads are manufactured from AAR steel specification TC-128, normalized; (ii) A higher test pressure is required if otherwise specified in this subchapter; and (iii) Other than as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, a tank car which does not conform to the requirements of this paragraph (f)(1), and was authorized for a hazardous substance under the regulations in effect on June 30, 1996, may continue in use until July 1, 2006. (2) List of hazardous substances. Hazardous substances for which the provisions of this paragraph (f) apply are as follows: (g) Tank car loading and unloading. When placed for loading or unloading and before unsecuring any closure, a tank car must be protected against shifting or coupling as follows: (1) Each hazmat employee who is responsible for loading or unloading a tank car must secure access to the track to prevent entry by other rail equipment, including motorized service vehicles. Derails, lined and locked switches, portable bumper blocks, or other equipment that provides an equivalent level of security may be used to satisfy this requirement. (2) Caution signs must be displayed on the track or on the tank cars to warn persons approaching the cars from the open end of the track and must be left up until after all closures are secured and the cars are in proper condition for transportation. The caution signs must be of metal or other durable material, rectangular, at 30.48 cm (12 inches) high by 38.10 cm (15 inches) wide, and bear the word “STOP.” The word “STOP” must appear in letters at least 10.16 cm (4 inches) high. The letters must be white on a blue background. Additional words, such as “Tank Car Connected” or “Crew at Work,” may also appear in white letters under the word “STOP.” (3) At least one wheel on the tank car must be blocked against motion in both directions, and the hand brakes must be set. If multiple tank cars are coupled together, sufficient hand brakes must be set and wheels blocked to prevent motion in both directions.

(i) Additional requirements for portable tanks other than IM specification and UN portable tanks. (1) The bursting strength of any piping and fittings must be at least four times the design pressure of the tank, and at least four times the pressure to which, in any instance, it may be subjected in service by the action of a pump or other device (not including safety relief valves) that may subject piping to pressures greater than the design pressure of the tank. (2) Pipe joints must be threaded, welded or flanged. If threaded pipe is used, the pipe and pipe fittings must not be lighter than Schedule 80 weight. Where copper tubing is permitted, joints must be brazed or be of equally strong metal union type. The melting point of brazing material may not be lower than 1,000 °F (537.8 °C). The method of joining tubing must not decrease the strength of the tubing such as by the cutting of threads. (3) Non-malleable metals may not be used in the construction of valves or fittings. (4) Suitable provision must be made in every case to allow for expansion, contraction, jarring and vibration of all pipe. Slip joints may not be used for this purpose. (5) Piping and fittings must be grouped in the smallest practicable space and must be protected from damage as required by the specification. (6) All piping, valves and fittings on every portable tank must be leakage tested with gas or air after installation and proved tight at not less than the design pressure of the portable tank on which they are used. In the event of replacement, all such piping, valves, or fittings must be tested in accordance with the requirements of this section before the portable tank is returned to transportation service. The requirements of this section apply to all hoses used on portable tanks, except that hoses may be tested either before or after installation on the portable tank. (7) All materials used in the construction of portable tanks and their appurtenances may not be subject to destructive attack by the contents of the portable tank.

(9) Each outlet of a portable tank used for the transportation of non-refrigerated liquefied compressed gases, except carbon dioxide, must be provided with a suitable automatic excess-flow valve (see definition in § 178.337-1(g) of this subchapter). The valve must be located inside the portable tank or at a point outside the portable tank where the line enters or leaves the portable tank. The valve seat must be located inside the portable tank or may be located within a welded flange or its companion flange, or within a nozzle or within a coupling. The installation must be made in such a manner as to reasonably assure that any undue strain which causes failure requiring functioning of the valve shall cause failure in such a manner that it will not impair the operation of the valve. (i) A safety device connection or liquid level gauging device that is constructed so that the outward flow of the tank contents will not exceed that passed by an opening of 0.1397 cm (0.0550 inches) is not required to be equipped with excess-flow valves. (ii) An excess-flow valve must close automatically if the flow reaches the rated flow of gas or liquid specified by the original valve manufacturer when piping mounted directly on the valve is sheared off before the first valve, pump, or fitting downstream from the excess flow valve. (iii) An excess-flow valve may be designed with a by-pass, not to exceed a 0.1016 cm (0.040 inches) diameter opening to allow equalization of pressure. (iv) Filling and discharge lines must be provided with manually operated shut-off valves located as close to the tank as practical. Unless this valve is manually operable at the valve, the line must also have a manual shut-off valve. The use of “Stop-Check” valves to satisfy with one valve the requirements of this section is forbidden. For portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases, a “stop check” valve may be used on the vapor side of the pressure buildup circuit. (10) Each portable tank used for carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide must be lagged with a suitable insulation material of such thickness that the overall thermal conductance is not more than 0.08 Btu per square foot per degree Fahrenheit differential in temperature per hour. The conductance must be determined at 60 °Fahrenheit. Insulation material used on portable tanks for nitrous oxide must be noncombustible. (11) Refrigerating or heating coils must be installed in portable tanks used for carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Such coils must be tested externally to at least the same pressure as the test pressure of the portable tank. The coils must also be tested internally to at least twice the working pressure of the heating or refrigerating system to be used, but in no case less than the test pressure of the portable tank. Such coils must be securely anchored. In the event of leakage, the refrigerant or heating medium to be circulated through the coil or coils must have no adverse chemical reaction with the portable tank or its contents. (12) Excess flow valves are not required for portable tanks used for the transport of refrigerated liquefied gases."},{"part":"173","section":"173.33","subject":"Hazardous materials in cargo tank motor vehicles.","type":"regulations","fullText":"(a) General requirements.

The venting capacity requirements of the original DOT cargo tank specification must be met whenever a pressure relief valve is modified. (e) Retention of hazardous materials in product piping during transportation. DOT specification cargo tanks used for the transportation of any material that is a Division 6.1 (poisonous liquid) material, oxidizer liquid, liquid organic peroxide or corrosive liquid (corrosive to skin only) may not be transported with hazardous materials lading retained in the piping, unless the cargo tank motor vehicle is equipped with bottom damage protection devices meeting the requirements of § 178.337-10 or § 178.345-8(b) of this subchapter, or the accident damage protection requirements of the specification under which it was manufactured. This requirement does not apply to a residue which remains after the piping is drained. A sacrificial device (see § 178.345-1 of this subchapter) may not be used to satisfy the accident damage protection requirements of this paragraph. (f) An MC 331 type cargo tank may be used where MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, DOT 406, DOT 407 or DOT 412 type cargo tanks are authorized. An MC 307, MC 312, DOT 407 or DOT 412 type cargo tank may be used where MC 306 or DOT 406 type cargo tanks are authorized. A higher integrity tank used instead of a specified tank must meet the same design profile (for example, an MC 331 cargo tank must be lined if used in place of a lined MC 312 cargo tank.) (g) Remote control of self-closing stop valves—MC 330, MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks. Each liquid or vapor discharge opening in an MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank and each liquid filling and liquid discharge line in an MC 338 cargo tank must be provided with a remotely controlled internal self-closing stop valve except when an MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank is marked and used exclusively to transport carbon dioxide; an MC 338 is used to transport argon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, or xenon; or an MC 338 utilizes an external self-closing stop valve to comply with the requirements in § 178.338-11(b). However, if the cargo tank motor vehicle was certified before January 1, 1995, this requirement is applicable only when an MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank is used to transport a flammable liquid, flammable gas, hydrogen chloride (refrigerated liquid), or anhydrous ammonia; or when an MC 338 cargo tank is used to transport flammable ladings.

For the purposes of this subchapter, an explosive means any substance or article, including a device, which is designed to function by explosion ( i.e., an extremely rapid release of gas and heat) or which, by chemical reaction within itself, is able to function in a similar manner even if not designed to function by explosion, unless the substance or article is otherwise classed under the provisions of this subchapter. The term includes a pyrotechnic substance or article, unless the substance or article is otherwise classed under the provisions of this subchapter. (b) Explosives in Class 1 are divided into six divisions as follows: (1) Division 1.1 consists of explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the entire load instantaneously. (2) Division 1.2 consists of explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard. (3) Division 1.3 consists of explosives that have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard. (4) Division 1.4 consists of explosives that present a minor explosion hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package. (5) Division 1.5 1 consists of very insensitive explosives. This division is comprised of substances which have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of transport. 1 The probability of transition from burning to detonation is greater when large quantities are transported in a vessel. (6) Division 1.6 2 consists of extremely insensitive articles that do not have a mass explosion hazard.

Initiation, means of. (1) A device intended to cause the detonation of an explosive (for example: detonator, detonator for ammunition, or detonating fuze). (2) The term with its own means of initiation means that the contrivance has its normal initiating device assembled to it and this device is considered to present a significant risk during transport but not one great enough to be unacceptable. The term does not apply, however, to a contrivance packed together with its means of initiation, provided the device is packaged so as to eliminate the risk of causing detonation of the contrivance in the event of functioning of the initiating device. The initiating device can even be assembled in the contrivance provided there are protective features ensuring that the device is very unlikely to cause detonation of the contrivance under conditions which are associated with transport. (3) For the purposes of classification, any means of initiation without two effective protective features should be regarded as Compatibility Group B; an article with its own means of initiation, without two effective protective features, is Compatibility Group F. A means of initiation which itself possesses two effective protective features is Compatibility Group D, and an article with its own means of initiation which possesses two effective features is Compatibility Group D or E. A means of initiation, adjudged as having two effective protective features, must be approved by the Associate Administrator. A common and effective way of achieving the necessary degree of protection is to use a means of initiation which incorporates two or more independent safety features.

The term includes Bangalore torpedoes. Phlegmatized. The term means that a substance (or “phlegmatizer”) has been added to an explosive to enhance its safety in handling and transport. The phlegmatizer renders the explosive insensitive, or less sensitive, to the following actions: heat, shock, impact, percussion or friction. Typical phlegmatizing agents include, but are not limited to: wax, paper, water, polymers (such as chlorofluoropolymers), alcohol and oils (such as petroleum jelly and paraffin). Powder cake (powder paste). Substance consisting of nitrocellulose impregnated with not more than 60 percent of nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrates or a mixture of these. Powder, smokeless. Substance based on nitrocellulose used as propellant.

Each packaging used for an explosive must be capable of meeting the test requirements of subpart M of part 178 of this subchapter, at the specified level of performance, and the applicable general packaging requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. (b) The general requirements for packaging of explosives are as follows: (1) Nails, staples, and other closure devices, made of metal, having no protective covering may not penetrate to the inside of the outer packaging unless the inner packaging adequately protects the explosive against contact with the metal. (2) The closure device of containers for liquid explosives must provide double protection against leakage, such as a screw cap secured in place with tape. (3) Inner packagings, fittings, and cushioning materials, and the placing of explosive substances or articles in packages, must be such that the explosive substance is prevented from becoming loose in the outer packaging during transportation. Metallic components of articles must be prevented from making contact with metal packagings. Articles containing explosive substances not enclosed in an outer casing must be separated from each other in order to prevent friction and impact. Padding, trays, partitioning in the inner or outer packaging, molded plastics or receptacles may be used for this purpose. (4) When the packaging includes water that could freeze during transportation, a sufficient amount of anti-freeze, such as denatured ethyl alcohol, must be added to the water to prevent freezing. If the anti-freeze creates a fire hazard, it may not be used. When a percentage of water in the substance is specified, the combined weight of water and anti-freeze may be substituted. (5) If an article is fitted with its own means of ignition or initiation, it must be effectively protected from accidental actuation during normal conditions of transportation. (6) The entry of explosive substances into the recesses of double-seamed metal packagings must be prevented. (7) The closure device of a metal drum must include a suitable gasket; if the closure device includes metal-to-metal screw-threads, the ingress of explosive substances into the threading must be prevented. (8) Whenever loose explosive substances or the explosive substance of an uncased or partly cased article may come into contact with the inner surface of metal packagings (1A2, 1B2, 4A, 4B and metal receptacles), the metal packaging should be provided with an inner liner or coating. (9) Packagings must be made of materials compatible with, and impermeable to, the explosives contained in the package, so that neither interaction between the explosives and the packaging materials, nor leakage, causes the explosive to become unsafe in transportation, or the hazard division or compatibility group to change ( see § 173.24(e)(2)). (10) An explosive article containing an electrical means of initiation that is sensitive to external electromagnetic radiation, must have its means of initiation effectively protected from electromagnetic radiation sources (for example, radar or radio transmitters) through either design of the packaging or of the article, or both. (11) Plastic packagings may not be able to generate or accumulate sufficient static electricity to cause the packaged explosive substances or articles to initiate, ignite or inadvertently function. Metal packagings must be compatible with the explosive substance they contain. (12) Explosive substances may not be packed in inner or outer packagings where the differences in internal and external pressures, due to thermal or other effects, could cause an explosion or rupture of the package. (13) Packagings for water soluble substances must be water resistant. Packagings for desensitized or phlegmatized substances must be closed to prevent changes in concentration during transport. When containing less alcohol, water, or phlegmatizer than specified in its proper shipping description, the substance is a “forbidden” material. (14) Large and robust explosives articles, normally intended for military use, without their means of initiation or with their means of initiation containing at least two effective protective features, may be carried unpackaged provided that a negative result was obtained in Test Series 4 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria on an unpackaged article. When such articles have propelling charges or are self-propelled, their ignition systems must be protected against conditions encountered during normal transportation. Such unpackaged articles may be fixed to cradles or contained in crates or other suitable handling, storage or launching devices in such a way that they will not become loose during normal conditions of transport and are in accordance with DOD-approved procedures. When such large explosive articles, as part of their operational safety and suitability tests, are subjected to testing that meets the intentions of Test Series 4 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria with successful test results, they may be offered for transportation in accordance with the requirements prescribed in (b)(14) above subject to approval by the Associate Administrator."},{"part":"173","section":"173.61","subject":"Mixed packaging requirements.","type":"regulations","fullText":"(a) An explosive may not be packed in the same outside packaging with any other material that could, under normal conditions of transportation, adversely affect the explosive or its packaging unless packaged by DOD or DOE in accordance with § 173.7(a). (b) Hardware necessary for assembly of explosive articles at the point-of-use may be packed in the same outside packaging with the explosive articles. The hardware must be securely packed in a separate inside packaging. Sufficient cushioning materials must be used to ensure that all inside packagings are securely packed in the outside packaging.

For the purpose of this subchapter, a non-flammable, nonpoisonous compressed gas (Division 2.2) means any material (or mixture) which— (1) Exerts in the packaging a gauge pressure of 200 kPa (29.0 psig/43.8 psia) or greater at 20 °C (68 °F), is a liquefied gas or is a cryogenic liquid, and (2) Does not meet the definition of Division 2.1 or 2.3. (c) Division 2.3 (Gas poisonous by inhalation). For the purpose of this subchapter, a gas poisonous by inhalation (Division 2.3) means a material which is a gas at 20 °C (68 °F) or less and a pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) (a material which has a boiling point of 20 °C (68 °F) or less at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia)) and which— (1) Is known to be so toxic to humans as to pose a hazard to health during transportation, or (2) In the absence of adequate data on human toxicity, is presumed to be toxic to humans because when tested on laboratory animals it has an LC 50 value of not more than 5000 mL/m 3 (see § 173.116(a) of this subpart for assignment of Hazard Zones A, B, C or D). LC 50 values for mixtures may be determined using the formula in § 173.133(b)(1)(i) or CGA P-20 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). (d) Non-liquefied compressed gas. A gas, which when packaged under pressure for transportation is entirely gaseous at −50 °C (−58 °F) with a critical temperature less than or equal to −50 °C (−58 °F), is considered to be a non-liquefied compressed gas. (e) Liquefied compressed gas. A gas, which when packaged under pressure for transportation is partially liquid at temperatures above −50 °C (−58 °F), is considered to be a liquefied compressed gas. Gas mixtures with component(s) that are liquefied gases may be described using the hazardous materials description of a compressed gas in the Hazardous Materials Table in § 172.101 of this subchapter when the partial pressure(s) of the liquefied gas component(s) in the mixture are reduced so that the mixture is entirely in the gas phase at 20 °C (68 °F).

(l) The following applies to aerosols (see § 171.8 of this subchapter): (1) An aerosol must be assigned to Division 2.1 if the contents include 85% by mass or more flammable components and the chemical heat of combustion is 30 kJ/g or more; (2) An aerosol must be assigned to Division 2.2 if the contents contain 1% by mass or less flammable components and the heat of combustion is less than 20 kJ/g. (3) Aerosols not meeting the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) or (1)(2) of this section must be classed in accordance with the appropriate tests of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). An aerosol which was tested in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter in effect on December 31, 2005, is not required to be retested. (4) Division 2.3 gases may not be transported in an aerosol container. (5) When the contents are classified as Division 6.1, PG III or Class 8, PG II or III, the aerosol must be assigned a subsidiary hazard of Division 6.1 or Class 8, as appropriate. (6) Substances of Division 6.1, PG I or II, and substances of Class 8, PG I are forbidden from transportation in an aerosol container. (7) Flammable components are Class 3 flammable liquids, Division 4.1 flammable solids, or Division 2.1 flammable gases. The chemical heat of combustion must be determined in accordance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). (m) Adsorbed gas.

(2) A flammable liquid with a flash point at or above 38 °C (100 °F) that does not meet the definition of any other hazard class may be reclassed as a combustible liquid. This provision does not apply to transportation by vessel or aircraft, except where other means of transportation is impracticable. An elevated temperature material that meets the definition of a Class 3 material because it is intentionally heated and offered for transportation or transported at or above its flash point may not be reclassed as a combustible liquid.

The liquid shall be allowed to evaporate under ambient pressure and temperature (20 to 25 °C (68 to 77 °F)) for a period of 4 hours or until 10 percent by volume has evaporated, whichever comes first. A flash point is then run on a portion of the liquid remaining in the evaporation container and the lower of the two flash points shall be the flash point of the material.

Where the flow time exceeds 100 seconds, a further test is carried out using the ISO standard cup with a 6 mm (0.24 inch) jet. (ii) Solvent Separation Test. This test is carried out at 23 °C (73 °F) using a 100.0 mL(3 ounces) measuring cylinder of the stoppered type of approximately 25.0 cm (9.8 inches) total height and of a uniform internal diameter of approximately 30 mm (1.2 inches) over the calibrated section. The sample should be stirred to obtain a uniform consistency, and poured in up to the 100 mL (3 ounces) mark. The stopper should be inserted and the cylinder left standing undisturbed for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the height of the upper separated layer should be measured and the percentage of this layer as compared with the total height of the sample calculated.

A self-reactive substance identified by technical name in the Self-Reactive Materials Table in § 173.224 is assigned to a generic type in accordance with that table. Self-reactive materials not identified in the Self-Reactive Materials Table in § 173.224 are assigned to generic types under the procedures of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. (A) Type A. Self-reactive material type A is a self-reactive material which, as packaged for transportation, can detonate or deflagrate rapidly. Transportation of type A self-reactive material is forbidden.

A self-reactive material meeting all characteristics of type G except thermal stability is classed as a type F self-reactive, temperature control material. (iii) Procedures for assigning a self-reactive material to a generic type. A self-reactive material must be assigned to a generic type based on— (A) Its physical state ( i.e. liquid or solid), in accordance with the definition of liquid and solid in § 171.8 of this subchapter; (B) A determination as to its control temperature and emergency temperature, if any, under the provisions of § 173.21(f); (C) Performance of the self-reactive material under the test procedures specified in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) and the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section; and (D) Except for a self-reactive material which is identified by technical name in the Self-Reactive Materials Table in § 173.224(b) or a self-reactive material which may be shipped as a sample under the provisions of § 173.224, the self-reactive material is approved in writing by the Associate Administrator. The person requesting approval shall submit to the Associate Administrator the tentative shipping description and generic type and— ( 1 ) All relevant data concerning physical state, temperature controls, and tests results; or ( 2 ) An approval issued for the self-reactive material by the competent authority of a foreign government. (iv) Tests. The generic type for a self-reactive material must be determined using the testing protocol from Figure 20.1 (a) and (b) (Flow Chart Scheme for Self-Reactive Substances and Organic Peroxides) from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(b) Division 4.2 (Spontaneously Combustible Material). For the purposes of this subchapter, spontaneously combustible material (Division 4.2) means— (1) A pyrophoric material. A pyrophoric material is a liquid or solid that, even in small quantities and without an external ignition source, can ignite within five (5) minutes after coming in contact with air when tested according to UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. (2) Self-heating material. A self-heating material is a material that through a process where the gradual reaction of that substance with oxygen (in air) generates heat. If the rate of heat production exceeds the rate of heat loss, then the temperature of the substance will rise which, after an induction time, may lead to self-ignition and combustion. A material of this type which exhibits spontaneous ignition or if the temperature of the sample exceeds 200 °C (392 °F) during the 24-hour test period when tested in accordance with UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), is classed as a Division 4.2 material.

Division 5.2 organic peroxides are assigned to a generic system which consists of seven types. An organic peroxide identified by technical name in the Organic Peroxides Table in § 173.225 is assigned to a generic type in accordance with that table. Organic peroxides not identified in the Organic Peroxides table are assigned to generic types under the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. (1) Type A. Organic peroxide type A is an organic peroxide which can detonate or deflagrate rapidly as packaged for transport. Transportation of type A organic peroxides is forbidden. (2) Type B. Organic peroxide type B is an organic peroxide which, as packaged for transport, neither detonates nor deflagrates rapidly, but can undergo a thermal explosion. (3) Type C. Organic peroxide type C is an organic peroxide which, as packaged for transport, neither detonates nor deflagrates rapidly and cannot undergo a thermal explosion. (4) Type D. Organic peroxide type D is an organic peroxide which— (i) Detonates only partially, but does not deflagrate rapidly and is not affected by heat when confined; (ii) Does not detonate, deflagrates slowly, and shows no violent effect if heated when confined; or (iii) Does not detonate or deflagrate, and shows a medium effect when heated under confinement.

An organic peroxide meeting all characteristics of type G except thermal stability and requiring temperature control is classed as a type F, temperature control organic peroxide. (c) Procedure for assigning an organic peroxide to a generic type. An organic peroxide shall be assigned to a generic type based on— (1) Its physical state (i.e., liquid or solid), in accordance with the definitions for liquid and solid in § 171.8 of this subchapter; (2) A determination as to its control temperature and emergency temperature, if any, under the provisions of § 173.21(f); and (3) Performance of the organic peroxide under the test procedures specified in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.

A liquid or solid with an LD 50 for acute oral toxicity of not more than 300 mg/kg. (ii) Dermal Toxicity. A material with an LD 50 for acute dermal toxicity of not more than 1000 mg/kg. (iii) Inhalation Toxicity. (A) A dust or mist with an LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation of not more than 4 mg/L; or (B) A material with a saturated vapor concentration in air at 20 °C (68 °F) greater than or equal to one-fifth of the LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation of vapors and with an LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation of vapors of not more than 5000 mL/m 3 ; or (2) Is an irritating material, with properties similar to tear gas, which causes extreme irritation, especially in confined spaces. (b) For the purposes of this subchapter— (1) LD 50 (median lethal dose) for acute oral toxicity is the statistically derived single dose of a substance that can be expected to cause death within 14 days in 50% of young adult albino rats when administered by the oral route. The LD 50 value is expressed in terms of mass of test substance per mass of test animal (mg/kg). (2) LD 50 for acute dermal toxicity means that dose of the material which, administered by continuous contact for 24 hours with the shaved intact skin (avoiding abrading) of an albino rabbit, causes death within 14 days in half of the animals tested. The number of animals tested must be sufficient to give statistically valid results and be in conformity with good pharmacological practices. The result is expressed in mg/kg body mass. (3) LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation means that concentration of vapor, mist, or dust which, administered by continuous inhalation for one hour to both male and female young adult albino rats, causes death within 14 days in half of the animals tested. If the material is administered to the animals as a dust or mist, more than 90 percent of the particles available for inhalation in the test must have a diameter of 10 microns or less if it is reasonably foreseeable that such concentrations could be encountered by a human during transport. The result is expressed in mg/L of air for dusts and mists or in mL/m 3 of air (parts per million) for vapors. See § 173.133(b) for LC 50 determination for mixtures and for limit tests. (i) When provisions of this subchapter require the use of the LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation of dusts and mists based on a one-hour exposure and such data is not available, the LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation based on a four-hour exposure may be multiplied by four and the product substituted for the one-hour LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation. (ii) When the provisions of this subchapter require the use of the LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation of vapors based on a one-hour exposure and such data is not available, the LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation based on a four-hour exposure may be multiplied by two and the product substituted for the one-hour LC 50 for acute toxicity on inhalation. (iii) A solid substance should be tested if at least 10 percent of its total mass is likely to be dust in a respirable range, e.g. the aerodynamic diameter of that particle-fraction is 10 microns or less. A liquid substance should be tested if a mist is likely to be generated in a leakage of the transport containment. In carrying out the test both for solid and liquid substances, more than 90% (by mass) of a specimen prepared for inhalation toxicity testing must be in the respirable range as defined in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii). (c) For purposes of classifying and assigning packing groups to mixtures possessing oral or dermal toxicity hazards according to the criteria in § 173.133(a)(1), it is necessary to determine the acute LD 50 of the mixture. If a mixture contains more than one active constituent, one of the following methods may be used to determine the oral or dermal LD 50 of the mixture: (1) Obtain reliable acute oral and dermal toxicity data on the actual mixture to be transported; (2) If reliable, accurate data is not available, classify the formulation according to the most hazardous constituent of the mixture as if that constituent were present in the same concentration as the total concentration of all active constituents; or (3) If reliable, accurate data is not available, apply the formula: This formula also may be used for dermal toxicities provided that this information is available on the same species for all constituents. The use of this formula does not take into account any potentiation or protective phenomena.

For the purposes of this subchapter, the following definitions and classification criteria apply to Division 6.2 materials. (1) Division 6.2 (Infectious substance) means a material known or reasonably expected to contain a pathogen. A pathogen is a microorganism (including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi) or other agent, such as a proteinaceous infectious particle (prion) that can cause disease in humans or animals. An infectious substance must be assigned the identification number UN2814, UN2900, UN3291, UN3373, or UN3549 as appropriate, and must be assigned to one of the following categories: (i) Category A: An infectious substance in a form capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs. An exposure occurs when an infectious substance is released outside of its protective packaging, resulting in physical contact with humans or animals. A Category A infectious substance must be assigned to identification number UN2814, UN2900, or UN3549, as appropriate. Assignment to UN2814, UN2900, or UN3549 must be based on the known medical history or symptoms of the source patient or animal, endemic local conditions, or professional judgment concerning the individual circumstances of the source human or animal. (ii) Category B: An infectious substance that is not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs. This includes Category B infectious substances transported for diagnostic or investigational purposes. A Category B infectious substance must be described as “Biological substance, Category B” and assigned identification number UN3373. This does not include regulated medical waste, which must be assigned identification number UN3291. (2) Biological product means a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of arsphenamine (or any other trivalent arsenic compound) applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings or animals. A biological product includes a material subject to regulation under 42 U.S.C. 262 or 21 U.S.C. 151-159. Unless otherwise excepted, a biological product known or reasonably expected to contain a pathogen that meets the definition of a Category A or B infectious substance must be assigned the identification number UN 2814, UN 2900, or UN 3373, as appropriate. (3) Culture means an infectious substance containing a pathogen that is intentionally propagated. Culture does not include a human or animal patient specimen as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. (4) Patient specimens means those collected directly from humans or animals and transported for research, diagnosis, investigational activities, or disease treatment or prevention. Patient specimens includes excreta, secreta, blood and its components, tissue and tissue swabs, body parts, and specimens in transport media ( e.g., transwabs, culture media, and blood culture bottles). (5) Regulated medical waste or clinical waste or (bio) medical waste means a waste or reusable material derived from the medical treatment of an animal or human, which includes diagnosis and immunization, or from biomedical research, which includes the production and testing of biological products. Regulated medical waste or clinical waste or (bio) medical waste containing a Category A infectious substance must be classed as an infectious substance, and assigned to UN2814, UN2900, or UN3549, as appropriate. (6) Sharps means any object contaminated with a pathogen or that may become contaminated with a pathogen through handling or during transportation and also capable of cutting or penetrating skin or a packaging material. Sharps includes needles, syringes, scalpels, broken glass, culture slides, culture dishes, broken capillary tubes, broken rigid plastic, and exposed ends of dental wires. (7) Toxin means a Division 6.1 material from a plant, animal, or bacterial source. A toxin containing an infectious substance or a toxin contained in an infectious substance must be classed as Division 6.2, described as an infectious substance, and assigned to UN 2814 or UN 2900, as appropriate. (8) Used health care product means a medical, diagnostic, or research device or piece of equipment, or a personal care product used by consumers, medical professionals, or pharmaceutical providers that does not meet the definition of a patient specimen, biological product, or regulated medical waste, is contaminated with potentially infectious body fluids or materials, and is not decontaminated or disinfected to remove or mitigate the infectious hazard prior to transportation. (b) Exceptions. The following are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter as Division 6.2 materials: (1) A material that does not contain an infectious substance or that is unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals. (2) Non-infectious biological materials from humans, animals, or plants. Examples include non-infectious cells, tissue cultures, blood or plasma from individuals not suspected of having an infectious disease, DNA, RNA or other non-infectious genetic elements. (3) A material containing micro-organisms that are non-pathogenic to humans or animals. (4) A material containing pathogens that have been neutralized or inactivated such that they no longer pose a health risk. (5) A material with a low probability of containing an infectious substance, or where the concentration of the infectious substance is at a level naturally occurring in the environment so it cannot cause disease when exposure to it occurs. Examples of these materials include: Foodstuffs; environmental samples, such as water or a sample of dust or mold; and substances that have been treated so that the pathogens have been neutralized or deactivated, such as a material treated by steam sterilization, chemical disinfection, or other appropriate method, so it no longer meets the definition of an infectious substance. (6) A biological product, including an experimental or investigational product or component of a product, subject to Federal approval, permit, review, or licensing requirements, such as those required by the Food and Drug Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

(8) Blood, blood plasma, and blood components collected for the purpose of blood transfusion or the preparation of blood products and sent for testing as part of the collection process, except where the person collecting the blood has reason to believe it contains an infectious substance, in which case the test sample must be shipped as a Category A or Category B infectious substance in accordance with § 173.196 or § 173.199, as appropriate. (9) Dried blood spots or specimens for fecal occult blood detection placed on absorbent filter paper or other material. (10) A Division 6.2 material, other than a Category A infectious substance, contained in a patient sample being transported for research, diagnosis, investigational activities, or disease treatment or prevention, or a biological product, when such materials are transported by a private or contract carrier in a motor vehicle used exclusively to transport such materials. Medical or clinical equipment and laboratory products may be transported aboard the same vehicle provided they are properly packaged and secured against exposure or contamination.

When the table to § 172.101 provides more than one packing group for a Class 8 material, the packing group must be determined using data obtained from tests conducted in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, Test No. 435, “ In Vitro Membrane Barrier Test Method for Skin Corrosion” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); or Test No. 404, “Acute Dermal Irritation/Corrosion” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Alternatively, a substance or mixture may be considered not corrosive to human skin for the purposes of this subchapter following testing in accordance with OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals Test No. 430, “ In Vitro Skin Corrosion: Transcutaneous Electrical Resistance test (TER)” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); Test No. 431, “ In Vitro Skin Corrosion: Reconstructed Human Epidermis (RHE) Test Method” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); or Test No. 439, “ In Vitro Skin Irritation: Reconstructed Human Epidermis Test Method” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). However, if the substance or mixture is determined to be corrosive in accordance with Test No. 430 or Test No. 439, the material may be assigned to Packing Group I, or must be further tested using Test No. 435 or Test No. 404 to determine the packaging group assignment. If the results of Test No. 431 indicate that the substance or mixture is corrosive, but the test method does not clearly distinguish between assignment of Packing Groups II and III, the material must be assigned to Packing Group II unless further testing is performed. The packing group assignment using data obtained from tests conducted in accordance with OECD Guideline Test No. 404 must be as follows: (a) Packing Group I. Materials that cause irreversible damage to intact skin tissue within an observation period of up to 60 minutes, starting after the exposure time of three minutes or less. (b) Packing Group II. Materials, other than those meeting Packing Group I criteria, that cause irreversible damage to intact skin tissue within an observation period of up to 14 days, starting after the exposure time of more than three minutes but not more than 60 minutes. (c) Packing Group III. Materials, other than those meeting Packing Group I or II criteria— (1) That cause irreversible damage to intact skin tissue within an observation period of up to 14 days, starting after the exposure time of more than 60 minutes but not more than 4 hours; or (2) That do not cause irreversible damage to intact skin tissue but exhibit a corrosion on either steel or aluminum surfaces exceeding 6.25 mm (0.25 inch) a year at a test temperature of 55 °C (130 °F) when tested on both materials. The corrosion may be determined in accordance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) or other equivalent test methods. (d) Alternative packing group assignment methods for mixtures. For mixtures it is necessary to obtain or derive information that allows the criteria to be applied to the mixture for the purpose of classification and assignment of packing groups. The approach to classification and assignment of packing groups is tiered, and is dependent upon the amount of information available for the mixture itself, for similar mixtures and/or for its ingredients. The flow chart in Figure 1 to paragraph (d) outlines the process to be followed: (1) Bridging principles. Where a mixture has not been tested to determine its skin corrosion potential, but there is sufficient data on both the individual ingredients and similar tested mixtures to adequately classify and assign a packing group for the mixture, this data will be used in accordance with the following bridging principles. This ensures that the classification process uses the available data to the greatest extent possible in characterizing the hazards of the mixture. (i) Dilution. If a tested mixture is diluted with a diluent, which does not meet the criteria for Class 8 and does not affect the packing group of other ingredients, then the new diluted mixture may be assigned to the same packing group as the original tested mixture. In certain cases, diluting a mixture or substance may lead to an increase in the corrosive properties. If this is the case, this bridging principle cannot be used. (ii) Batching. The skin corrosion potential of a tested production batch of a mixture can be assumed to be substantially equivalent to that of another untested production batch of the same commercial product when produced by or under the control of the same manufacturer, unless there is reason to believe there is significant variation such that the skin corrosion potential of the untested batch has changed. If the latter occurs, a new classification is necessary. (iii) Concentration of mixtures of packing group I. If a tested mixture meeting the criteria for inclusion in Packing Group I is concentrated, the more concentrated untested mixture may be assigned to Packing Group I without additional testing. (iv) Interpolation within one packing group. For three mixtures (A, B and C) with identical ingredients, where mixtures A and B have been tested and are in the same skin corrosion packing group, and where untested mixture C has the same Class 8 ingredients as mixtures A and B but has concentrations of Class 8 ingredients intermediate to the concentrations in mixtures A and B, then mixture C is assumed to be in the same skin corrosion packing group as A and B. (v) Substantially similar mixtures. Given the following: (A) Two mixtures: (A+B) and (C+B); (B) The concentration of ingredient B is the same in both mixtures; (C) The concentration of ingredient A in mixture (A+B) equals the concentration of ingredient C in mixture (C+B); (D) Data on skin corrosion for ingredients A and C are available and substantially equivalent, i.e., they are the same skin corrosion packing group and do not affect the skin corrosion potential of B. (E) If the above mixture (A+B) or (C+B) is already classified based on test data, then the other mixture may be assigned to the same packing group. (2) Calculation method based on the classification of the substances. Where a mixture has not been tested to determine its skin corrosion potential, nor is sufficient data available on similar mixtures, the corrosive properties of the substances in the mixture shall be considered to classify and assign a packing group. Applying the calculation method is only allowed if there are no synergistic effects that make the mixture more corrosive than the sum of its substances. This restriction applies only if Packing Group II or III would be assigned to the mixture. (i) All Class 8 ingredients present at a concentration of ≥1% shall be taken into account, or &lt;1% if these ingredients are still relevant for classifying the mixture to be corrosive to skin. (ii) To determine whether a mixture containing corrosive substances must be considered a corrosive mixture and to assign a packing group, the calculation method in the flow chart in appendix I must be applied. For this calculation method, generic concentration limits apply where 1% is used in the first step for the assessment of the packing group I substances, and where 5% is used for the other steps respectively. (iii) When a specific concentration limit (SCL) is assigned to a substance following its entry in the Hazardous Materials Table or in a special provision, this limit shall be used instead of the generic concentration limits (GCL). (iv) The following formula must be used for each step of the calculation process. The criterion for a packing group is fulfilled when the result of the calculation is ≥ 1. The generic concentration limits to be used for the evaluation in each step of the calculation method are those found in appendix I of this part. Where applicable, the generic concentration limit shall be substituted by the specific concentration limit assigned to the substance(s) (SCLi), and the adapted formula is a weighted average of the different concentration limits assigned to the different substances in the mixture: When an initial test on either a steel or aluminum surface indicates the material being tested is corrosive, the follow up test on the other surface is not required."},{"part":"173","section":"173.140","subject":"Class 9—Definitions.","type":"regulations","fullText":"For the purposes of this subchapter, miscellaneous hazardous material (Class 9) means a material which presents a hazard during transportation but which does not meet the definition of any other hazard class.

(c) Organic peroxides table. The following Organic Peroxides Table specifies by technical name those organic peroxides that are authorized for transportation and not subject to the approval provisions of § 173.128 of this part. An organic peroxide identified by technical name in the following table is authorized for transportation only if it conforms to all applicable provisions of the table. The column headings of the Organic Peroxides Table are as follows: (1) Technical name. The first column specifies the technical name. (2) ID number. The second column specifies the identification (ID) number which is used to identify the proper shipping name in the § 172.101 table. The word “EXEMPT” appearing in the column denotes that the material is not regulated as an organic peroxide. (3) Concentration of organic peroxide. The third column specifies concentration (mass percent) limitations, if any, in mixtures or solutions for the organic peroxide. Limitations are given as minimums, maximums, or a range, as appropriate. A range includes the lower and upper limits ( i.e. , “53-100” means from, and including, 53% to, and including 100%). See introductory paragraph of § 172.203(k) of this subchapter for additional description requirements for an organic peroxide that may qualify for more than one generic listing, depending on its concentration. (4) Concentration of diluents. The fourth column specifies the type and concentration (mass percent) of diluent or inert solid, when required. Other types and concentrations of diluents may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. (i) The required mass percent of “Diluent type A” is specified in column 4a. A diluent type A is an organic liquid that does not detrimentally affect the thermal stability or increase the hazard of the organic peroxide and with a boiling point not less than 150 °C at atmospheric pressure. Type A diluents may be used for desensitizing all organic peroxides. (ii) The required mass percent of “Diluent type B” is specified in column 4b. A diluent type B is an organic liquid which is compatible with the organic peroxide and which has a boiling point, at atmospheric pressure, of less than 150 °C (302 °F) but at least 60 °C (140 °F), and a flash point greater than 5 °C (41 °F). Type B diluents may be used for desensitizing all organic peroxides, when specified in the organic peroxide tables, provided that the boiling point is at least 60 °C (140 °F) above the SADT of the peroxide in a 50 kg (110 lbs) package. A type A diluent may be used to replace a type B diluent in equal concentration. (iii) The required mass percent of “Inert solid” is specified in column 4c. An inert solid is a solid that does not detrimentally affect the thermal stability or hazard of the organic peroxide. (5) Concentration of water. Column 5 specifies, in mass percent, the minimum amount of water, if any, which must be in formulation. (6) Packing method. Column 6 specifies the highest packing method (largest packaging capacity) authorized for the organic peroxide. Lower numbered packing methods (smaller packaging capacities) are also authorized. For example, if OP3 is specified, then OP2 and OP1 are also authorized. The Table of Packing Methods in paragraph (d) of this section defines the non-bulk packing methods. (7) Temperatures. Column 7a specifies the control temperature. Column 7b specifies the emergency temperature. Temperatures are specified only when temperature controls are required. (See § 173.21(f)). (8) Notes. Column 8 specifies other applicable provisions, as set forth in notes following the table. (d) Packing Method Table. Packagings for organic peroxides and self-reactive substances are listed in the Maximum Quantity per Packing Method Table. The packing methods are designated OP1 to OP8.

Fuel cell cartridges, including when contained in or packed with equipment, must be designed and constructed to prevent fuel leakage under normal conditions of transportation. Fuel cell cartridge design types using liquids as fuels must pass an internal pressure test at a gauge pressure of 100 kPa (15 psig) without leakage. Except for fuel cell cartridges containing hydrogen in metal hydride which must be in conformance with paragraph (d) of this section, each fuel cell cartridge design type including when contained in or packed with equipment, must pass a 1.2 meter (3.9 feet) drop test onto an unyielding surface in the orientation most likely to result in the failure of the containment system with no loss of contents. Fuel cell cartridges installed in or integral to a fuel cell system are regarded as contained in equipment. Fuel cell cartridges containing a Division 2.1, Division 4.3 or Class 8 material must meet the following additional requirements. (b) A fuel cell cartridge designed to contain a Division 4.3 or a Class 8 material may contain an activator provided it is fitted with two independent means of preventing unintended mixing with the fuel during transport. (c) Each fuel cell cartridge designed to contain a liquefied flammable gas must: (1) Be capable of withstanding, without leakage or bursting, a pressure of at least two times the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 55 °C (131 °F); (2) Contain no more than 200 mL of liquefied flammable gas with a vapor pressure not exceeding 1,000 kPa (150 psig) at 55 °C (131 °F); and (3) Pass the hot water bath test prescribed in accordance with § 173.306(a)(3)(v). (d) Each fuel cell cartridge designed to contain hydrogen in a metal hydride must conform to the following: (1) Each fuel cell cartridge must have a water capacity less than or equal to 120 mL (4 fluid ounces). (2) Each fuel cell cartridge must be a design type that has been subjected, without leakage or bursting, a pressure of at least two times the design pressure of the cartridge at 55 °C (131 °F) or 200 kPa (30 psig) more than the design pressure of the cartridge at 55 °C (131 °F), whichever is greater. The pressure at which the test is conducted is referred to as the “minimum shell burst pressure.” The pressure within the fuel cell cartridge must not exceed 5 MPa (725 psig) at 55 °C (131 °F). (3) Each fuel cell cartridge must be filled in accordance with the procedure provided by the manufacturer. The manufacturer must provide the following information with each fuel cell cartridge: (i) Inspection procedures to be carried out before initial filling and before refilling of the fuel cell cartridge; (ii) Safety precautions and potential hazards to be aware of; (iii) A method of determining when the rated capacity has been achieved; (iv) Minimum and maximum pressure range; (v) Minimum and maximum temperature range; and (vi) Any other requirements to be met for initial filling and refilling including the type of equipment to be used. (4) Each fuel cell cartridge must be permanently marked with the following information: (i) The rated charging pressure in megapascals (MPa); (ii) The manufacturer's serial number of the fuel cell cartridges or unique identification number; and (iii) The expiration date based on the maximum service life (yyyy/mm). (5) Design type tests: Each fuel cell cartridge design type must be subjected to and pass the following tests (this includes cartridges integral to a fuel cell): (i) Drop test. A 1.8 m (5.9 feet) drop test onto an unyielding surface must be performed. There must be no leakage. Leakage must be determined using a soap bubble solution or other equivalent means on all possible leak locations, when the fuel cell cartridge is charged to its rated charging pressure. The fuel cell cartridge must then be hydrostatically pressurized to destruction. The burst pressure must be greater than 85% of the minimum shell burst pressure. The drop must be performed in the following four different orientations: (A) Vertically, on the end containing the shut-off valve assembly; (B) Vertically, on the end opposite to the shut-off valve assembly; (C) Horizontally, onto a steel apex with a diameter of 3.8 cm (9.7 in), with the steel apex in the upward position; and (D) At a 45° angle on the end containing the shut-off valve assembly. (ii) Fire test. A fuel cell cartridge filled to rated capacity (with hydrogen) must be subjected to a fire engulfment test. The cartridge design (including design types with an integral vent feature) is deemed to pass the fire test if: (A) The internal pressure vents to zero gauge pressure without the rupture of the cartridge; or (B) The cartridge withstands the fire for a minimum of 20 minutes without rupture. (iii) Hydrogen cycling test. A fuel cell cartridge must be subjected to a hydrogen cycling test to ensure that the design stress limits are not exceeded during use. The fuel cell cartridge must be cycled from not more than 5% rated hydrogen capacity to not less than 95% rated hydrogen capacity and back to not more than 5% rated hydrogen capacity. The rated charging pressure must be used for charging and temperatures must be within the operating temperature range. The cycling must be continued for at least 100 cycles. Following the cycling test the fuel cell cartridge must be charged and the water volume displaced by the cartridge must be measured. The cartridge design is deemed to pass the test if the water volume displaced by the cycled cartridge does not exceed the water volume displaced by an uncycled cartridge charged to 95% rated capacity and pressurized to 75% of its minimum shell burst pressure. (6) Production leak test. Each fuel cell cartridge must be tested for leaks at 15 °C ±5 °C (59 °F ±9 °F) while pressurized to its rated charging pressure. There must be no leakage. Leakage must be determined using a soap bubble solution or other equivalent means on all possible leak locations. (e) The following packagings are authorized provided the general packaging requirements subpart B of part 173 of this subchapter are met: (1) For fuel cell cartridges, rigid packagings conforming to the requirements of part 178 of this subchapter at the packing group II performance level; and (2) Strong outer packagings for fuel cell cartridges contained in equipment or packed with equipment. Large equipment containing fuel cell cartridges may be transported unpackaged if the equipment provides an equivalent level of protection. (i) Fuel cell cartridges packed with equipment must be packed with cushioning material or divider(s) or inner packagings so that the fuel cell cartridges are protected against damage that may be caused by the shifting or placement of the equipment and cartridges within the packaging. (ii) For fuel cell cartridges contained in equipment, the entire fuel cell system must be protected against short circuits and unintentional activation. The equipment must be securely cushioned in the outer packaging. (f) For transportation by aircraft, the following additional provisions apply: (1) The package must comply with the applicable provisions of § 173.27 of this subchapter; (2) For fuel cell cartridges contained in equipment, fuel cell systems must not charge batteries during transport; (3) For transportation aboard passenger aircraft, for fuel cell cartridges contained in equipment, each fuel cell system and fuel cell cartridge must conform to IEC 62282-6-100 and IEC 62282-6-100 Amend. 1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) or a standard approved by the Associate Administrator; (4) When packed with equipment, fuel cell cartridges must be packed in an intermediate packaging along with the equipment they are capable of powering, and the intermediate packagings packed in a strong outer packaging.

For the purposes of this section, “article” means machinery, apparatus, or other devices containing one or more hazardous materials (or residues thereof) that are an integral element of the article, necessary for its functioning, and that cannot be removed for the purpose of transport. An inner packaging is not an article. For articles that do not have an existing proper shipping name and that contain only hazardous materials within the permitted limited quantity amounts specified in column (8A) of the § 172.101 Table, see UN3363, Dangerous goods in machinery or apparatus, as prescribed in § 172.102(c)(1), Special provision 136, and § 173.222. (b) Such articles may contain batteries. Lithium batteries that are integral to the article must be of a type proven to meet the testing requirements of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 38.3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), except when otherwise specified by this subchapter. (c) This section does not apply to articles for which a more specific proper shipping name already exists in the § 172.101 Table. This section does not apply to hazardous materials of Class 1, Division 6.2, Class 7, or radioactive material contained in articles. (d) Articles containing hazardous materials must be assigned to the appropriate class or division determined by the hazards present using, where applicable, the precedence criteria prescribed in § 173.2a for each of the hazardous materials contained in the article. If hazardous materials classified as Class 9 are contained within the article, all other hazardous materials present in the article must be considered to present a higher hazard. (e) Subsidiary hazards must be representative of the primary hazard posed by the other hazardous materials contained within the article. When only one item of hazardous materials is present in the article, the subsidiary hazard(s), if any, is the subsidiary hazard(s) identified in column 6 of the § 172.101 Table. If the article contains more than one item of hazardous materials and these could react dangerously with one another during transport, each of the hazardous materials must be enclosed separately. (f)(1) Packagings must conform to the Packing Group II performance level. The following packagings are authorized: (i) Drums (1A2, 1B2, 1N2, 1H2, 1D, 1G); (ii) Boxes (4A, 4B, 4N, 4C1, 4C2, 4D, 4F, 4G, 4H1, 4H2); and (iii) Jerricans (3A2, 3B2, 3H2). (2) In addition, for robust articles, the following non-specification packagings are authorized: (i) Strong outer packagings constructed of suitable material and of adequate strength and design in relation to the packaging capacity and its intended use. Each package must conform to the packaging requirements of subpart B of this part, except for the requirements in §§ 173.24(a)(1) and 173.27(e). (ii) Articles may be transported unpackaged or on pallets when the hazardous materials are afforded equivalent protection by the article in which they are contained. (g) The nature of the containment must be as follows— (1) In the event of damage to the receptacles containing the hazardous materials, no leakage of the hazardous materials from the machinery or apparatus is possible. A leakproof liner may be used to satisfy this requirement. (2) Receptacles containing hazardous materials must be secured and cushioned so as to prevent their breakage or leakage and to control their movement within the machinery or apparatus during normal conditions of transportation. Cushioning material must not react dangerously with the content of the receptacles. Any leakage of the contents must not substantially impair the protective properties of the cushioning material. (3) Receptacles for gases, their contents, and filling densities must conform to the applicable requirements of this subchapter, unless otherwise approved by the Associate Administrator. (h) For transport by aircraft, the following additional requirements apply: (1) Articles transported under UN3548, which do not have an existing proper shipping name, and which contain only environmentally hazardous substances where the quantity of the environmentally hazardous substance in the article exceeds 5 L or 5 kg, must be prepared for transport in accordance with this section for transport by air. In addition to the environmentally hazardous substance, the article may also contain lithium cells or batteries that comply with § 173.185(c)(4). (2) Articles transported under UN3538, which do not have an existing proper shipping name, and which contain only gases of Division 2.2 without a subsidiary hazard, but excluding refrigerated liquefied gases and gases forbidden for transport on passenger aircraft, where the quantity of the Division 2.2 gas exceeds the quantity limits for UN 3363, as prescribed in § 173.222 must be prepared for transport in accordance with this section. Articles transported under this provision are limited to a maximum net quantity of gas of 75 kg by passenger aircraft and 150 kg by cargo-only aircraft. In addition to the Division 2.2 gas, the article may also contain lithium cells or batteries that comply with § 173.185(c)(4)."},{"part":"173","section":"173.240","subject":"Bulk packaging for certain low hazard solid materials.","type":"regulations","fullText":"When § 172.101 of this subchapter specifies that a hazardous material be packaged under this section, only the following bulk packagings are authorized, subject to the requirements of subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter and the special provisions specified in column 7 of the § 172.101 table.

(g) General requirements. Bulk packagings authorized or used for transport of elevated temperature materials must conform to the following requirements: (1) Pressure and vacuum control equipment. When pressure or vacuum control equipment is required on a packaging authorized in this section, such equipment must be of a self-reclosing design, must prevent package rupture or collapse due to pressure, must prevent significant release of lading due to packaging overturn or splashing or surging during normal transport conditions, and may be external to the packaging. (i) Pressure control equipment is not required if pressure in the packaging would increase less than 10 percent as a result of heating the lading from the lowest design operating temperature to a temperature likely to be encountered if the packaging were engulfed in a fire. When pressure control equipment is required, it must prevent rupture of the packaging from heating, including fire engulfment. (ii) Vacuum control equipment is not required if the packaging is designed to withstand an external pressure of 100 kPa (14.5 psig) or if pressure in the packaging would decrease less than 10 percent as a result of the lading cooling from the highest design operating temperature to the lowest temperature incurred in transport. When vacuum control equipment is required, it must prevent collapse of the packaging from a cooling-induced pressure differential. (iii) When the regulations require a reclosing pressure relief device, the lading must not render the devices inoperable (i.e. from clogging, freezing, or fouling). If the lading affects the proper operation of the device, the packaging must have: (A) A safety relief device incorporating a frangible disc or a permanent opening, each having a maximum effective area of 22 cm 2 (3.4 in. 2 ), for transportation by highway; (B) For transportation of asphalt by highway, a safety relief device incorporating a frangible disc or a permanent opening, each having a maximum effective area of 48 cm 2 (7.4 in 2 ); or (C) For transportation by rail, a non-reclosing pressure relief device incorporating a rupture disc conforming to the requirements of § 179.15 of this subchapter. (iv) Reclosing pressure relief devices, rupture discs or permanent openings must not allow the release of lading during normal transportation conditions (i.e., due to splashing or surging). (2) Closures. All openings, except permanent vent openings authorized in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, must be securely closed during transportation. Packagings must be substantially leak-tight so as not to allow any more than dripping or trickling of a non-continuous flow when overturned. Closures must be designed and constructed to withstand, without exceeding the yield strength of the packaging, twice the static loading produced by the lading in any packaging orientation and at all operating temperatures. (3) Strength. Each packaging must be designed and constructed to withstand, without exceeding the yield strength of the packaging, twice the static loading produced by the lading in any orientation and at all operating temperatures. (4) Compatibility. The packaging and lading must be compatible over the entire operating temperature range. (5) Markings. In addition to any other markings required by this subchapter, each packaging must be durably marked in a place readily accessible for inspection in characters at least 4.8 mm (3/16 inch) with the manufacturer's name, date of manufacture, design temperature range, and maximum product weight (or “load limit” for tank cars) or volumetric capacity. (6) Accident damage protection. For transportation by highway, external loading and unloading valves and closures must be protected from impact damage resulting from collision or overturn. Spraying equipment and the road oil application portion of a packaging are excepted from this requirement. (7) New construction. Specification packagings that are being manufactured for the transport of elevated temperature materials must be authorized for current construction. (h) Exceptions —(1) General.

Unless otherwise stated, as used in this section, the term “cylinder” includes a UN pressure receptacle. As used in this subpart, filled or charged means an introduction or presence of a hazardous material in a cylinder. A cylinder filled with a Class 2 hazardous material (gas) and offered for transportation must meet the requirements in this section and §§ 173.301a through 173.305, as applicable. (1) Compressed gases must be in UN pressure receptacles built in accordance with the UN standards or in metal cylinders and containers built in accordance with the DOT and ICC specifications and part 178 of this subchapter in effect at the time of manufacture or CRC, BTC, CTC or TC specification, and requalified and marked as prescribed in subpart C in part 180 of this subchapter, if applicable. The DOT, ICC, CRC, BTC, CTC and TC specifications authorized for use are as follows: (2) A cylinder must be filled in accordance with this part, except that a “TC” cylinder must be filled in accordance with the Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Before each filling of a cylinder, the person filling the cylinder must visually inspect the outside of the cylinder. A cylinder that has a crack or leak, is bulged, has a defective valve or a leaking or defective pressure relief device, or bears evidence of physical abuse, fire or heat damage, or detrimental rusting or corrosion, may not be filled and offered for transportation. A cylinder may be repaired and requalified only as prescribed in subpart C of part 180 of this subchapter. (3) Pressure relief devices must be tested for leaks before a filled cylinder is shipped from the cylinder filling plant. It is expressly forbidden to repair a leaking fusible plug device where the leak is through the fusible metal or between the fusible metal and the opening in the plug body, except by removal and replacement of the pressure relief device. (4) A cylinder that previously contained a Class 8 material must be requalified in accordance with § 180.205(e) of this subchapter. (5) When a cylinder with a marked pressure limit is prescribed, another cylinder made under the same specification but with a higher marked pressure limit is authorized. For example, a cylinder marked “DOT-4B500” may be used when “DOT-4B300” is specified. (6) No person may fill a cylinder overdue for periodic requalification with a hazardous material and then offer it for transportation. The prohibition against offering a cylinder for transportation that is overdue for periodic requalification does not apply to a cylinder filled prior to the requalification due date. (7) A cylinder with an authorized service life may not be offered for transportation in commerce after its authorized service life has expired. However, a cylinder in transportation or a cylinder filled prior to the expiration of its authorized service life may be transported for reprocessing or disposal of the cylinder's contents. After emptying, the cylinder must be condemned in accordance with § 180.205 of this subchapter. (8) The pressure of the hazardous material at 55 °C (131 °F) may not exceed 5/4 of the service pressure of the cylinder.

For a pressure range, any container outside of the set range must be rejected. The instruments used to determine the pressure must be properly calibrated before a production run to an accuracy of ±or better; and ( 2 ) Periodic inspection. At designated intervals, a randomly selected container must be inspected for proper closure and verification of filling pressure. If a container shows signs of improper closure or over-filling, five (5) additional randomly selected containers must be inspected. If any of the additional containers show signs of improper closure or over-filling, all containers produced since the last inspection must be rejected. (C) Weight test. Each person employing a weight test of filled containers must develop procedures for implementation of the test. Each person must maintain a copy of the procedures (or an electronic file thereof) that is accessible at, or through, its principal place of business and must make the procedures available upon request, at a reasonable time and location, to an authorized official of the Department. The procedures must, at a minimum, include instruction on the following: ( 1 ) Weight specifications. Each person must specify target weight specifications for a particular container. Each container, after it is filled, must be weighed and compared to the target weight specification for the container. Any container outside the target weight specification is an indication of leakage or overfilling and must be rejected. The instruments used to determine the weight must be properly calibrated before a testing run and be sufficiently sensitive to measure within 0.10 g of the true weight of the container; ( 2 ) Heat testing and pressure limits. One container out of each lot of successfully filled containers must be heat tested by raising the internal pressure until it reaches that which would be reached at 55 °C (131 °F). The lot size should be no greater than 2,000. If the pressure in the container exceeds the maximum pressure allowed for the container type or if the container shows signs of leakage or permanent deformation, the lot must be rejected. Alternatively, five (5) additional randomly selected containers from the lot may be tested to qualify the lot but if any of the five containers fail the test, the entire lot must be rejected; ( 3 ) Periodic inspection. At intervals of not more than 10 minutes, a randomly selected container must be inspected for proper closure and verification of filling pressure. If a container shows signs of improper closure or over-filling, five (5) additional randomly selected containers must be inspected. If any of the additional containers show signs of improper closure or over-filling, all containers produced since the last inspection must be rejected; and ( 4 ) Visual inspection. Each container must be visually inspected prior to being packed. Any container showing signs of leakage or permanent deformation must be rejected. (D) Leakage test. ( 1 ) Pressure and leak testing before filling. Each empty container must be subjected to a pressure equal to or in excess of the maximum expected in the filled containers at 55 °C (131 °F) or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F). This must be at least two-thirds of the design pressure of the container. If any container shows evidence of leakage at a rate equal to or greater than 3.3 × 10 −2 mbar L/s at the test pressure, distortion or other defect, it must be rejected; and ( 2 ) Testing after filling. The person filling each container must ensure that the crimping equipment is set appropriately and the specified propellant is used before filling a container. Once filled, each container must be weighed and leak tested. The leak detection equipment must be sufficiently sensitive to detect at least a leak rate of 2.0 × 10 −3 mbar L/s at 20 °C (68 °F). Any filled container which shows evidence of leakage, deformation, or overfilling must be rejected. (vi) Each outer packaging must be marked “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH PRESCRIBED REGULATIONS.” (4) Gas samples must be transported under the following conditions: (i) A gas sample may only be transported as non-pressurized gas when its pressure corresponding to ambient atmospheric pressure in the container is not more than 105 kPa absolute (15.22 psia). (ii) Non-pressurized gases, toxic (or toxic and flammable) must be packed in hermetically sealed glass or metal inner packagings of not more than one L (0.3 gallons) overpacked in a strong outer packaging. (iii) Non-pressurized gases, flammable must be packed in hermetically sealed glass or metal inner packagings of not more than 5 L (1.3 gallons) and overpacked in a strong outer packaging.

Additional exceptions for aerosols conforming to this paragraph (a)(5) are provided in paragraph (i) of this section. (i) Capacity. The capacity of the container must not exceed 1 L (61.0 cubic inches). (ii) General pressure conditions. Authorized plastic aerosol containers and associated pressure limitations are provided in the following table. The pressure in the container must not exceed 160 psig at 54.4 °C (130 °F). The container must be capable of withstanding without bursting a pressure of at least one and one-half times the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 54.4 °C (130 °F). (iii) Liquid fill. Liquid content of the material and gas must not completely fill the container at 54.4 °C (130 °F). (iv) Outer packaging. The containers must be packed in strong outer packagings. (v) Pressure testing. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section, each container must be subjected to a test performed in a hot water bath. The temperature of the bath and the duration of the test must be such that the internal pressure reaches that which would be reached at 55 °C (131 °F) or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F). If the contents are sensitive to heat, or if the container is made of plastic material which softens at this test temperature, the temperature of the bath must be set at between 20 °C (68 °F) and 30 °C (86 °F) but, in addition, one container in 2,000 must be tested at the higher temperature. No leakage or permanent deformation of a container is permitted except that a plastic container may be deformed through softening provided that it does not leak. (vi) Leakage test. As an alternative to the hot water bath test in paragraph (a)(5)(v) of this section, testing may be performed as follows: (A) Pressure and leak testing before filling. Each empty container must be subjected to a pressure equal to or in excess of the maximum expected in the filled containers at 55 °C (131 °F) or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F). This must be at least two-thirds of the design pressure of the container. If any container shows evidence of leakage at a rate equal to or greater than 3.3 × 10 −2 mbar L/s at the test pressure, distortion or other defect, it must be rejected; and (B) Testing after filling. Prior to filling, the filler must ensure that the crimping equipment is set appropriately and the specified propellant is used before filling the container. Once filled, each container must be weighed and leak tested. The leak detection equipment must be sufficiently sensitive to detect at least a leak rate of 2.0 × 10 −3 mbar L/s at 20 °C (68 °F). Any filled container that shows evidence of leakage, deformation, or excessive weight must be rejected.

No person may offer for transportation or transport a lighter (see § 171.8 of this subchapter) containing a Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material except under the following conditions: (1) The lighter must contain a fuel reservoir not exceeding 4 fluid ounces capacity (7.22 cubic inches), and must contain not more than 10 grams (0.35 ounce) of flammable gas. (2) The maximum filling density may not exceed 85 percent of the volumetric capacity of each fluid reservoir at 15 °C (59 °F). (3) Each lighter design, including closures, must be capable of withstanding, without leakage or rupture, an internal pressure of at least two times the pressure of the flammable gas at 55 °C (131 °F). (4) Each appropriate lighter design must be examined and successfully tested by a person or agency (authorized testing agency) who is authorized by the Associate Administrator to perform such examination and testing under the provisions of subpart E of part 107 of this chapter and who— (i) Has the equipment necessary to perform the testing required to the level of accuracy required; (ii) Is able to demonstrate, upon request, the knowledge of the testing procedures and requirements of the HMR relative to lighters; (iii) Does not manufacture or market lighters, is not financially dependent or owned in whole or in part, by any entity that manufactures or markets lighters; (iv) Is a resident of the United States; and (v) Performs all examination and testing in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) and (4) of this section. (5) The Associate Administrator will assign an identification code to each person who is authorized to examine and test lighters. This identification code must be incorporated into a unique test report identifier for each successfully tested lighter design. (b) Examination and testing of lighter design types —(1) Lighter design type definition. A new lighter design is one that has never been examined and tested or one that differs from a previous design in any manner that may affect the escape (leakage) of gas. Lighter characteristics that may affect the escape of gas include changes in materials of construction, ignition mechanism, burner valve design, wall thickness, sealing materials, and type of fuel (e.g., vapor pressure differences). (2) Lighter samples submitted for examination and testing. Samples of a new lighter design are excepted from the requirements of (a)(4) and (d) of this section and may be offered for transportation and transported under the following conditions: (i) The samples must be transported only to an authorized testing agency; (ii) No more than 12 lighters may be packaged in a single outer packaging; (iii) Inner packagings must conform to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For transportation by aircraft, intermediate or outer packagings must meet the pressure differential requirements of § 173.27(c) of this part; (iv) The outer packaging must conform to the requirements of subpart M of part 178 of this subchapter at the Packing Group I performance level and to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subpart; (v) The word “sample” must appear on the shipping paper as part of the proper shipping name or in association with the basic description; and (vi) In addition to other required markings and labels, the package must be marked “SAMPLE FOR EXAMINATION AND TESTING.” (vii) All other applicable requirements of this subchapter must be met. (3) Examination and testing of sample lighters by an authorized testing agency. Each sample lighter must be examined for conformance with paragraph (a) of this section by a person authorized by the Associate Administrator. In addition, lighters must be subjected to the following leakage test: (i) A minimum of six lighters must be examined and tested at one time. Store the lighters in a desiccator for 24 hours. After drying, weigh each lighter on an analytical balance capable of accurately measuring to within 1/10 of a milligram (0.0001 grams). (ii) After weighing, place the lighters together in an explosion-proof, controlled-temperature laboratory oven capable of maintaining 38 ±1 °C (100 ±2 °F) for 96 continuous hours (4 days). At the end of 96 hours, remove the lighters from the oven and place them in the same desiccator and allow the lighters to cool to ambient temperature. (iii) After cooling, weigh each lighter and determine the net weight differences for each lighter tested (subtract the mass after oven exposure from the original mass before oven exposure). (iv) Weight losses must be assessed to determine the quantity of gas that leaked from the lighters and from the weight change as a result of absorbed moisture. If the net weight has increased, the test facility must run the required test using six empty lighters in parallel with the six filled lighters. The parallel tests are conducted to determine the weight of moisture absorbed in the plastic in order to determine the weight loss of the lighters from gas leakage. (v) If the net weight loss for any one of the six lighters exceeds 20 milligrams (0.020 grams), the design must be rejected. (vi) Lighters manufactured to a rejected lighter design may not be offered for transportation or transported in commerce unless approved in writing by the Associate Administrator. (4) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) Following the examination of each new lighter design, the person or agency that conducted the examination and test must prepare a test report and make that test report available to the manufacturer. At a minimum, the test report must contain the following information: (A) Name and address of test facility; (B) Name and address of applicant; (C) A test report identifier, that is, the authorized person or agency identifier code immediately followed by an alpha/numeric identifier of four or more characters assigned to the specific lighter design by the authorized person or agency (e.g., “LAA****,” where, “LAA” is the identification code assigned to the authorized person or agency by the Associate Administrator and “****” is replaced with the unique test report identifier assigned to the specific lighter design by the authorized person or agency); (D) Manufacturer of the lighter. For a foreign manufacturer, the U.S. agent or importer must be identified; (E) Description of the lighter design type (e.g., model, dimensions, ignition mechanism, reservoir capacity, lot/batch number) in sufficient detail to ensure conformance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section; and (F) A certification by the authorized testing agency that the lighter design conforms to paragraph (a) of this section and passes or does not pass the required leakage test in paragraph (b) of this section. (ii) For as long as any lighter design is in production and for at least three years thereafter, a copy of each lighter's test report must be maintained by the authorized testing agency that performed the examination and testing and the manufacturer of the design. For a foreign manufacturer, each test report must be maintained in accordance with this paragraph by the foreign manufacturer's U.S. agent or importer. (iii) Test reports must be traceable to a specific lighter design and must be made available to a representative of the Department upon request. (5) Transitional provisions. Until January 1, 2012, approval numbers issued by the Associate Administrator prior to January 1, 2007 may continue to be marked on packages and annotated on shipping papers, where applicable. After that time, previously issued approvals ( i.e., T-***) will no longer be valid and each lighter design currently in production must be re-examined and tested under the provisions of this section. (c) Packaging requirements —(1) Inner containment. Lighters must be placed in an inner packaging that is designed to prevent shifting of the lighters and inadvertent ignition or leakage. The ignition device and gas control lever of each lighter must be designed, or securely sealed, taped, or otherwise fastened or packaged to protect against accidental functioning or leakage of the contents during transport. If lighters are packed vertically in a plastic tray, a plastic, fiberboard or paperboard partition must be used to prevent friction between the ignition device and the inner packaging. (2) Outer packaging. Lighters and their inner packagings must be tightly packed and secured against shifting in any rigid specification outer packaging authorized in subpart L of part 178 of this subchapter at the Packing Group II performance level. (d) Shipping paper and marking requirements. (1) In addition to the requirements of subpart C of part 172, shipping papers must be annotated with the lighter design test report identifier (see paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section) traceable to the test report assigned to the lighters or, if applicable, the previously issued approval number ( i.e., T* * *), in association with the basic description. (2) In addition to the requirements of subpart D of part 172, a lighter design test report identifier (see paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section) or, if applicable, the previously issued approval number ( i.e., T* * *), must be marked on a package containing lighters. (e) Exceptions —(1) Common or contract carriage. For highway transportation by common or contract carrier, when no more than 1,500 lighters covered by this section are transported in one motor vehicle, the requirements of subparts C through H of part 172, and part 177 of this subchapter do not apply. Lighters transported in accordance with this paragraph are also excepted from the specification packaging, shipping paper, and marking requirements specified in § 173.308(c) and (d). Inner packagings must conform to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Lighters must be further packaged in rigid, strong outer packagings meeting the general packaging requirements of subpart B of part 173. Outer packagings must be plainly and durably marked, on two opposing sides or ends, with the word “LIGHTERS” and the number of devices contained therein in letters measuring at least 20 mm (0.79 in) in height. In addition, the package must include the test report identifier for each lighter design as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section or, if applicable, the previously issued approval number ( i.e., T***). The test report identifier or approval number must be durable, legible, in English, and located in, attached to, or marked directly on the package. No person may offer for transportation or transport the lighters or prepare the lighters for shipment unless that person has been specifically informed of the requirements of this section. (2) Private carriage. For highway transportation by a private carrier, lighters that have been examined and successfully tested in accordance with this section are not subject to any other requirements of this subchapter under the following conditions: (i) No person may offer for transportation or transport the lighters or prepare the lighters for shipment unless that person has been specifically informed of the requirements of this section; (ii) Lighters must be placed in an inner packaging that is designed to prevent accidental activation of the ignition device or valve, release of gas, and shifting of the lighters ( e.g., tray, blister pack, etc.); (iii) Inner packagings must be placed in a securely closed rigid outer packaging that limits shifting of the inner packagings and protects them from damage; (iv) The outer package may contain not more than 300 lighters; (v) A transport vehicle may carry not more than 1,500 lighters at any one time; (vi) The lighters may not be placed in an outer packaging with other hazardous materials; and (vii) Outer packagings must be plainly and durably marked with the words “LIGHTERS, excepted quantity.”"},{"part":"173","section":"173.309","subject":"Fire extinguishers.","type":"regulations","fullText":"This section applies to portable fire extinguishers for manual handling and operation, fire extinguishers for installation in aircraft, fire extinguishers for installation as part of a fire suppression system, and large fire extinguishers.

cars.","type":"regulations","fullText":"(a) Definitions. For definitions of compressed gases, see § 173.115. (b) General requirements. (1) Tank car tanks containing compressed gases must not be shipped unless they were loaded by or with the consent of the owner thereof. (2) Tank car tanks must not contain gases capable of combining chemically and must not be loaded with any gas which combines chemically with the gas previously loaded therein, until all residue has been removed and interior of tank thoroughly cleaned. (3) For tanks of the DOT-106A and 110A class, the tanks must be placed in position and attached to car structure by the shipper. (4) Wherever the word “approved” is used in this part of the regulations, it means approval by the Association of American Railroads Committee on Tank Cars as prescribed in § 179.3 of this subchapter. (5) Each tank car used for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia or any material that meets the criteria of Division 2.1 or 2.3 must have gaskets for manway cover plates and for mounting of fittings designed (for temperature, application, media, pressure, and size) to create a positive seal so that, under conditions normally incident to transportation, there will not be an identifiable release of the material to the environment. The use of sealants to install gaskets is prohibited. (c) Authorized gases, filling limits for tank cars. A compressed gas in a tank car or a multi-unit tank car must be offered for transportation in accordance with § 173.31 and this section. The gases listed below must be loaded and offered for transportation in accordance with the following table: (d) Alternative tank car tanks for materials poisonous by inhalation. (1) As an alternative to the authorized tank car specification noted in the column 4 of the table in paragraph (c) of this section, a car of the same authorized tank car specification but of the next lower test pressure, as prescribed in column 5 of the table at § 179.101-1, may be used provided both of the following conditions are met: (i) The difference between the alternative and the required minimum plate thicknesses, based on the calculation prescribed in § 179.100-6 of this subchapter, is added to the alternative tank car jacket and head shield. When the jacket and head shield are made from any authorized steel with a minimum tensile strength from 70,000 p.s.i. to 80,000 p.s.i., but the required minimum plate thickness calculation is based on steel with a minimum tensile strength of 81,000 p.s.i., the thickness to be added to the jacket and head shield must be increased by a factor of 1.157. Forming allowances for heads are not required to be considered when calculating thickness differences as prescribed in this paragraph. (ii) The tank car jacket and head shield must be manufactured from carbon steel plate as prescribed in § 179.100-7(a) of this subchapter. (e) Verification of content. (1) The amount of liquefied gas loaded into each tank may be determined either by measurement or calculation of the weight, except that DOT specification tank car tanks authorized for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia and ammonia solution may have the amount of liquefied gas loaded into the tank car measured by a metering device in conformance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (2) Metering device. (i) Tank cars loaded with anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution through the use of a metering device in conformance with this section are not required to be weighed, but must have their outage measured with a magnetic gauging device to determine that the tank car is properly loaded in conformance with this paragraph. Written procedures for loading a tank car using a metering device must be developed and made available at each location where such loading takes place. Certification in writing of the inspection and completion of these loading and/or unloading procedures must be maintained for each tank car and maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, and all necessary records must be completed. At a minimum, these procedures will specify: (A) The tank car must be offered for transportation in conformance with all applicable government regulations. (B) Any defects found when the tank car is examined before shipping must be recorded, and the tank must not be loaded until the repairs to eliminate each defect are completed. (C) The tank car must be allowed to sit undisturbed for at least 10 minutes after loading to allow material within the tank to settle. After this has occurred a final check for leaks must be conducted prior to offering the tank car for transportation. (ii) One out of every 10 tank cars loaded by the use of the metering device must be gauged utilizing the fixed gauging equipment on the tank car to verify by calculation the amount of anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution contained in the tank car. (iii) Recordkeeping. The following information must be maintained and be made available to any representative of the DOT upon request for each tank car loaded with the use of a metering device: (A) Date loaded, (B) Date shipped, (C) Tank car reporting marks, (D) DOT Specification, (E) Tank car stenciled shell capacity (gallons/liters), (F) Tank car stenciled tare weight (pounds/kilograms), (G) Outage or innage table number, (H) Water capacity of tank in pounds and/or kilograms, (I) Maximum permitted filling density (see § 173.314), (J) Specific gravity of anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution at the reference temperature, (K) Tank car outage (inches/meters, gallons/liters), (L) Gallons/liters of liquid ammonia in tank car, (M) Quantity of vapor ammonia in tank car (gallons/liters), and (N) Total calculated ammonia (liquid &amp; vapor) in tank car (pounds/kilograms). (f) [Reserved] (g) Special requirements for hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid, and vinyl fluoride,stabilized. (1) The shipper shall notify the Federal Railroad Administration whenever a tank car is not received by the consignee within 20 days from the date of shipment. Notification to the Federal Railroad Administration may be made by e-mail to Hmassist@fra.dot.gov or telephone call to (202) 493-6229. (2) A tank car containing hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid must have the auxiliary valve on the pressure relief device closed during transportation. (3) See § 179.102-17 of this subchapter for additional requirements. (4) Tank cars containing hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid, must be unloaded to such an extent that any residue remaining in the tank at a reference temperature of 32 °C (90 °F) will not actuate the reclosing pressure relief device. (h) Special requirements for liquefied petroleum gas —(1) Odorization. All liquefied petroleum gas must be odorized as required in this paragraph to indicate positively, by a distinctive odor, the presence of gas down to a concentration in air of not over one-fifth the lower limit of combustibility; however, odorization is not required if it is harmful in the use or further processing of the liquefied petroleum gas or if it will serve no useful purpose as a warning agent in such use or further processing. (i) The lower limits of combustibility of the more commonly used liquefied petroleum gases are: Propane, 2.15 percent; butane, 1.55 percent. These figures represent volumetric percentages of gas-air mixtures in each case. (ii) The use of 1.0 pound of ethyl mercaptan per 10,000 gallons of liquefied petroleum gas is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph. Use of another odorant is not prohibited so long as there is enough to meet the requirements of this paragraph (h). (2) Odorant fade. In addition to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the offeror must ensure that enough odorant will remain in the tank car during the course of transportation. The offeror must have procedures in place to: (i) Ensure quantitative testing methods are used to measure the amount of odorant in the liquefied petroleum gas; (ii) Ensure that, when the odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is manually injected, the required amount of odorant is added; (iii) Ensure that, when odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is automatically injected, equipment calibration checks are conducted to ensure the required amount of odorant is consistently added; (iv) Ensure quality control measures are in place to make sure that persons who receive tank cars that have been subjected to any condition that could lead to corrosion of the tank car or receive new or recently cleaned tank cars are notified of this information and that a person filling these packagings implement quality control measures so that potential odorant fade is addressed; (v) Inspect a tank car for signs of oxidation or corrosion; and (vi) Take corrective action needed to ensure enough odorization remains in the tank car during the course of transportation, such as increasing the amount of odorant added to the liquefied petroleum gas. (i) [Reserved] (j) Special requirements for materials having a primary or secondary Division 2.1 (flammable gas) hazard. For single unit tank cars, interior pipes of loading and unloading valves, sampling devices, and gauging devices with an opening for the passage of the lading exceeding 1.52 mm (0.060 inch) diameter must be equipped with excess flow valves. For single unit tank cars constructed before January 1, 1972, gauging devices must conform to this paragraph by no later than July 1, 2006. The protective housing cover must be provided with an opening, with a weatherproof cover, above each pressure relief valve that is concentric with the discharge of the pressure relief valve and that has an area at least equal to the valve outlet area. Class DOT 109 tank cars and tank cars manufactured from aluminum or nickel plate are not authorized. (k) Special requirements for chlorine. (1) Tank cars built after September 30, 1991, must have an insulation system consisting of 5.08 cm (2 inches) glass fiber placed over 5.08 cm (2 inches) of ceramic fiber. Tank cars must have excess flow valves on the interior pipes of liquid discharge valves. Tank cars constructed to a DOT 105A500W specification may be marked as a DOT 105A300W specification with the size and type of reclosing pressure relief valves required by the marked specification. (2) DOT105J500W tank cars may be used as authorized packagings, as prescribed in this subchapter for transporting “UN 1017, Chlorine, 2.3 (8), Poison Inhalation Hazard, Zone B, RQ,” if the tank cars meet all DOT specification requirements, and the tank cars are equipped with combination safety relief valves with a start-to-discharge pressure of 360 psi, rather than the 356 psi. The start-to-discharge pressure setting must be marked on the pressure relief device in conformance with applicable provisions of the AAR Specification for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). (l) Special requirements for hydrogen sulphide. Each multi-unit tank car must be equipped with adequate pressure relief devices of the fusible plug type having a yield temperature not over 76.66 °C (170 °F.), and not less than 69.44 °C (157 °F.). Each device must be resistant to extrusion of the fusible alloy and leak tight at 55 °C (130 °F.). A threaded solid plug must seal each valve outlet. In addition, a metal cover must protect all valves. (m) Special requirements for nitrosyl chloride. Single unit tank cars and their associated service equipment, such as venting, loading and unloading valves, and reclosing pressure relief valves, must be made of metal or clad with a material that is not subject to rapid deterioration by the lading. Multi-unit tank car tanks must be nickel-clad and have reclosing pressure relief devices incorporating a fusible plug having a yield temperature of 79.44 °C (175 °F.). Reclosing pressure relief devices must be vapor tight at 54.44 °C (130 °F.). (n) Special requirements for hydrogen. Each tank car must be equipped with one or more pressure relief devices. The discharge outlet for each pressure relief device must be connected to a manifold having a non-obstructed discharge area of at least 1.5 times the total discharge area of the pressure relief devices connected to the manifold. All manifolds must be connected to a single common header having a non-obstructed discharge pointing upward and extending above the top of the car. The header and the header outlet must each have a non-obstructed discharge area at least equal to the total discharge area of the manifolds connected to the header. The header outlet must be equipped with an ignition device that will instantly ignite any hydrogen discharged through the pressure relief device. (o) Special requirements for carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid and nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid. Each tank car must have an insulation system so that the thermal conductance is not more than 0.613 kilojoules per hour, per square meter, per degree Celsius (0.03 B.t.u. per square foot per hour, per degree Fahrenheit) temperature differential. Each tank car must be equipped with one reclosing pressure relief valve having a start-to-discharge pressure not to exceed 75 percent of the tank test pressure and one non-reclosing pressure relief valve having a rupture disc design to burst at a pressure less than the tank test pressure. The discharge capacity of each pressure relief device must be sufficient to prevent building up of pressure in the tank in excess of 82.5 percent of the test pressure of the tank. Tanks must be equipped with two regulating valves set to open at a pressure not to exceed 24.1 Bar (350 psi) on DOT 105A500W tanks and at a pressure not to exceed 27.6 Bar (400 psi) on DOT 105A600W tanks.

For cryogenic liquid in cargo tanks, see § 173.318. For marking requirements for portable tanks and cargo tanks, see § 172.326 and § 172.328 of this subchapter, as applicable. (1) UN portable tanks: UN portable tanks must be loaded and offered for transportation in accordance with portable tank provision T50 in § 172.102 of this subchapter. (2) Cargo tanks and DOT specification portable tanks: Cargo tanks and DOT specification portable tanks must be loaded and offered for transportation in accordance with the following table (for purposes of the following table, a column entry with “do” indicates “same as above”): (b) Maximum permitted filling densities for cargo and portable tank containers for transportation of butadiene, stabilized, and liquefied petroleum gas are as follows: (1) Odorization. All liquefied petroleum gas must be odorized as required in this paragraph to indicate positively, by a distinctive odor, the presence of gas down to a concentration in air of not over one-fifth the lower limit of combustibility; however, odorization is not required if it is harmful in the use or further processing of the liquefied petroleum gas or if it will serve no useful purpose as a warning agent in such use or further processing. (i) The lower limits of combustibility of the more commonly used liquefied petroleum gases are: Propane, 2.15 percent; butane, 1.55 percent. These figures represent volumetric percentages of gas-air mixtures in each case. (ii) The use of 1.0 pound of ethyl mercaptan per 10,000 gallons of liquefied petroleum gas is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph (b). Use of any other odorant is not prohibited so long as there is enough to meet the requirements of this paragraph. (2) Odorant fade. For cargo tanks or portable tanks being transported from a refinery, gas plant or pipeline terminal and in addition to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the offeror must ensure that enough odorant will remain in the cargo tank or portable tank during the course of transportation. The offeror must have procedures in place to: (i) Ensure quantitative testing methods are used to measure the amount of odorant in the liquefied petroleum gas; (ii) Ensure that, when the odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is manually injected, the required amount of odorant is being added; (iii) Ensure that, when odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is automatically injected, equipment calibration checks are conducted to ensure the required amount of odorant is consistently added; (iv) Ensure that quality control measures are in place to make sure that persons who receive cargo tanks or portable tanks that have been subjected to any condition that could lead to corrosion of the packaging or receive new or recently cleaned cargo tanks or portable tanks are notified of this information and that a person filling these packagings implement quality control measures to ensure that potential odorant fade is addressed; (v) Inspect a cargo tank or portable tank for signs of oxidation or corrosion; and (vi) Take corrective action needed to ensure enough odorant remains in the cargo tank or portable tank during the course of transportation, such as increasing the amount of odorant added to the liquefied petroleum gas. (c) Except as otherwise provided, the loading of a liquefied gas into a cargo tank or portable tank shall be determined by weight or by a suitable liquid level gauging device. The vapor pressure (psig) at 115 °F. must not exceed the design pressure of the cargo tank or portable tank container. The outage and filling limits for liquefied gases must be as prescribed in § 173.24b of this part, except that this requirement does not apply to: (1) A tank containing carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid. Such tank is required to be equipped with suitable pressure control valves and may not be filled to a level exceeding 95 percent of the volumetric capacity of the tank. (2) A tank containing ethane, refrigerated liquid; ethane-propane mixture, refrigerated liquid; or hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid. Such tank must be filled to allow at least two percent outage below the inlet of the pressure relief valve or pressure control valve under conditions of incipient opening, with the tank in a level attitude. (d) If the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied gases is to be determined by weight, the gross weight shall be checked after the filling line is disconnected in each instance. The gross weight shall be calculated from the tank capacity and tare weight set forth on the metal plate required by the specification, and the maximum filling density permitted for the material being loaded into the tank as set forth in the table, paragraph (a) of this section. (e) If the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied gases is to be determined by adjustable liquid level device, each tank and each compartment thereof shall have a thermometer well, so that the internal liquid temperature can easily be determined, and the amount of liquid in the tank shall be corrected to a 60 °F. basis. Liquid levels shall not exceed a level corresponding to the maximum filling density permitted for the material being loaded into the tank as set forth in the table in paragraph (a) of this section. (f) When the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied gases is determined only by fixed length dip tube or other fixed maximum liquid level indicator, the device shall be arranged to function at a level not to exceed the maximum permitted volume prescribed by the table, paragraph (a) of this section. Loading shall be stopped when the device functions. (g) Containers, the liquid level of which has been determined by means of a fixed length dip tube gauging device, shall not be acceptable for stowage as cargo on vessels in commerce subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard. Nothing contained in this section shall be so construed as to prohibit the transportation on car floats or car ferries of motor vehicles laden with containers nor cargo tanks the liquid level of either of which has been determined by means of fixed length dip tube devices. (h) Each cargo tank and portable tank, except a tank filled by weight, must be equipped with one or more of the gauging devices described in the following table which indicate accurately the maximum permitted liquid level (for purposes of the following table, a column entry with “do” indicates “same as above”). Additional gauging devices may be installed but may not be used as primary controls for filling of cargo tanks and portable tanks. Gauge glasses are not permitted on any cargo tank or portable tank. Primary gauging devices used on cargo tanks of less than 3500 gallons water capacity are exempt from the longitudinal location requirements specified in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section provided: The tank length does not exceed three times the tank diameter; and the cargo tank is unloaded within 24 hours after each filling of the tank. (1) The design pressure of the liquid level gauging devices shall be at least equal to the design pressure of the tank. (2) If the primary gauging device is adjustable, it must be capable of adjustment so that the end of the tube will be in the location specified in paragraph (h)(3) of this section for at least one of the ladings to be transported, at the filling level corresponding to an average loading temperature. Exterior means must be provided to indicate this adjustment. The gauging device must be legibly and permanently marked in increments not exceeding 20 Fahrenheit degrees (or not exceeding 25 p.s.i.g. on tanks for carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid), to indicate the maximum levels to which the tank may be filled with liquid at temperatures above 20 °F. However, if it is not practicable to so mark the gauging device, this information must be legibly and permanently marked on a plate affixed to the tank adjacent to the gauging device. (3) A dip tube gauging device consists of a pipe or tube with a valve at its outer end with its intake limited by an orifice not larger than 0.060 inch in diameter. If a fixed length dip tube is used, the intake must be located midway of the tank both longitudinally and laterally and at maximum permitted filling level. In tanks for liquefied petroleum gases, the intake must be located at the level reached by the lading when the tank is loaded to maximum filling density at 40 °F. (4) Except on a tank used exclusively for the transportation of carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid, each opening for a pressure gauge must be restricted at or inside the tank by an orifice no larger than 0.060 inch in diameter. For carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid service, the pressure gauge need only be used during the filling operation. (i) Each tank must be provided with one or more pressure relief devices which, unless otherwise specified in this part, must be of the spring-loaded type. Each valve must be arranged to discharge upward and unobstructed to the outside of the protective housing to prevent any impingement of escaping gas upon the tank. For each chlorine tank the protective housing must be in compliance with the requirements set forth in the applicable specification. (1) The safety relief valves on each tank must meet the following conditions: (i) The total relieving capacity, as determined by the flow formulas contained in Section 5 of CGA S-1.2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), must be sufficient to prevent a maximum pressure in the tank of more than 120 percent of the design pressure; (ii) The flow capacity rating, testing and marking must be in accordance with Sections 5, 6 and 7 of CGA Pamphlet S-1.2. (iii) For an insulated tank, the required relieving capacity of the relief devices must be the same as for an uninsulated tank, unless the insulation will remain in place and will be effective under fire conditions. In this case, except for UN portable tanks, each insulated tank must be covered by a sheet metal jacket of not less than 16 gauge thickness. For UN portable tanks where the relieving capacity of the valves has been reduced on the basis of the insulation system, the insulation system must remain effective at all temperatures less than 649 °C (1200.2 °F) and be jacketed with a material having a melting point of 700 °C (1292.0 °F) or greater. (iv) An MC 330 cargo tank that has relief valves sized by Fetterly's formula dated November 27, 1928, may be continued in service. (2) Each safety relief valve must be arranged to minimize the possibility of tampering. If the pressure setting or adjustment is external to the valve, the safety relief valve must be provided with means for sealing the adjustment and it must be sealed. (3) Each safety relief valve on a portable tank, other than a UN portable tank, must be set to start-to-discharge at pressure no higher than 110% of the tank design pressure and no lower than the design pressure specified in paragraph (a) of this section for the gas transported. For UN portable tanks used for liquefied compressed gases and constructed in accordance with the requirements of § 178.276 of this subchapter, the pressure relief device(s) must conform to § 178.276(e) of this subchapter. (4) Except for UN portable tanks, each safety relief valve must be plainly and permanently marked with the pressure in p.s.i.g. at which it is set to discharge, with the actual rate of discharge of the device in cubic feet per minute of the gas or of air at 60 °F (15.6 °C) and 14.7 p.s.i.a., and with the manufacturer's name or trade name and catalog number. The start-to-discharge valve marking must be visible after the valve is installed. The rated discharge capacity of the device must be determined at a pressure of 120% of the design pressure of the tank. For UN portable tanks, each pressure relief device must be clearly and permanently marked as specified in § 178.274(f)(1) of this subchapter. (5) Each safety relief valve must have direct communication with the vapor space in the tank. (6) Each connection to a safety relief valve must be of sufficient size to provide the required rate of discharge through the safety relief valve. (7) [Reserved] (8) Each pressure relief valve outlet must be provided with a protective device to prevent the entrance and accumulation of dirt and water. This device must not impede flow through the valve. Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of liquid and the development of any dangerous excess pressure. (9) On tanks for carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid each safety relief device must be installed and located so that the cooling effect of the contents will not prevent the effective operation of the device. In addition to the required safety relief valves, these tanks may be equipped with one or more pressure controlling devices. (10) Each tank for carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid also may be equipped with one or more non-reclosing pressure relief devices set to function at a pressure not over two times nor less than 1.5 times the design pressure of the tank. (11) Each portion of connected liquid piping or hose that can be closed at both ends must be provided with a safety relief valve without an intervening shut-off valve to prevent excessive hydrostatic pressure that could burst the piping or hose. (12) Subject to conditions of paragraph (a) of this section for the methyl chloride and sulfur dioxide optional portable tanks, one or more fusible plugs examined by the Bureau of Explosives and approved by the Associate Administrator may be used on these tanks in place of safety relief valves of the spring-loaded type. The fusible plug or plugs must be in accordance with CGA Pamphlet S-1.2, to prevent a pressure rise in the tank of more than 120 percent of the design pressure. If the tank is over 30 inches long, each end must have the total specified safety discharge area. (13) A safety relief valve on a chlorine cargo tank must conform to one of the following standards of The Chlorine Institute, Inc.: Type 1 1/2 JQ225, Dwg. H51970 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); or Type 1 1/2 JQ225, Dwg. H50155 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). (j) Consumer storage containers. (1) Storage containers for liquefied petroleum gas or propane charged to five percent of their capacity or less and intended for permanent installation on consumer premises may be shipped by private motor carrier under the following conditions: (i) Each container must be constructed in compliance with the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) and must be marked to indicate compliance in the manner specified by the respective Code. Containers built in compliance with earlier editions starting with 1943 are authorized. (ii) Each container must be equipped with safety devices in compliance with the requirements for safety devices on containers as specified in NFPA 58, Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). (iii) The containers must be braced or otherwise secured on the vehicle to prevent relative motion while in transit. Valves or other fittings must be adequately protected against damage during transportation. (See § 177.834(a) of this subchapter). (iv) Storage containers of less than 1,042 pounds water capacity (125 gallons) may be shipped when charged with liquefied petroleum gas in compliance with DOT filling density. (2) Storage containers with a water capacity not exceeding 500 gallons charged with liquefied petroleum gas to more than five percent of their capacity and intended for permanent installation on consumer premises may be transported by private motor carrier one-way only from the consumer's premises to the container owner's nearest facility under the following conditions: (i) Each container must be constructed in compliance with the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code and must be marked to indicate compliance in the manner specified by the respective Code. (ii) Maximum permitted filling density may not exceed that specified in paragraph (b) of this section. (iii) Prior to loading on a motor vehicle, the container must be inspected by a trained and qualified person for leaks, corroded or abraded areas, dents, distortions, weld defects, or other condition that may render the container unsafe for transportation. A record of the inspection must be legibly signed and dated by the person performing the inspection and retained by the container owner for two years. The signature on the inspection record represents a certification that the container has been inspected and has no defects that would render it unsafe for transportation under the HMR. The record of inspection must include the date of inspection, the inspector's contact information (such as a telephone number), the container's serial number and container size (water capacity), estimated amount of hazardous material, and the origin and destination of shipment. (iv) Only one storage container may be transported on a motor vehicle. (v) For loading on a motor vehicle, the container must be lifted by slings, which must be completely wrapped around the container. Lifting lugs may not be used. The slings must be rated to a weight sufficient to accommodate the container and its lading and shall comply with ASME B30.9 on slings used for lifting purposes, and must be visually inspected prior to each use. A sling showing evidence of tears, fraying, or other signs of excessive wear may not be used. (vi) The storage container must be secured on a motor vehicle so that the container is completely within the envelope of the vehicle and does not extend beyond the vehicle frame. (vii) The storage container must be placed on the vehicle in a manner, such as in a cradle, which ensures that no weight is placed on the supporting legs during transportation. (viii) The storage container must be secured against shifting during transportation. Bracing must conform with the requirements of paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section and § 177.834(a) of this subchapter and with Section 6-5.2 of NFPA 58, Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code. Straps or chains used as tie-downs must be rated to exceed the maximum load to be transported and conform to the requirements in §§ 393.100 through 393.106 of this title. (ix) Tow trailers used to transport storage containers in accordance with this paragraph (j)(2) must provide rear end protection that conforms to requirements in § 393.86 of this title. (k) A nonspecification cargo tank meeting, and marked in conformance with, the edition of Section VIII of the ASME Code in effect when it was fabricated may be used for the transportation of liquefied petroleum gas provided it meets all of the following conditions: (1) It must have a minimum design pressure no lower than 250 psig.

(2) Nurse tanks with missing or illegible ASME plates. Nurse tanks with missing or illegible ASME plates may continue to be operated provided they conform to the following requirements: (i) Each nurse tank must undergo an external visual inspection and testing in accordance with § 180.407(d) of this subchapter. (ii) Each nurse tank must be thickness tested in accordance with § 180.407(i) of this subchapter. A nurse tank with a capacity of less than 1,500 gallons must have a minimum head thickness of 0.203 inch and a minimum shell thickness of 0.239 inch. A nurse tank with a capacity of 1,500 gallons or more must have a minimum thickness of 0.250 inch. Any nurse tank with a thickness test reading of less than that specified in this paragraph at any point must be removed from hazardous materials service. (iii) Each nurse tank must be pressure tested in accordance with § 180.407(g) of this subchapter. The minimum test pressure is 375 psig. Pneumatic testing is not authorized. (iv) Each nurse tank must be inspected and tested by a person meeting the requirements of § 180.409(d) of this subchapter. Furthermore, each nurse tank must have the tests performed at least once every five years after the completion of the initial tests. (v) After each nurse tank has successfully passed the visual, thickness, and pressure tests, welded repairs on the tank are prohibited. (vi) After the nurse tank has successfully passed the visual, thickness, and pressure tests, it must be marked in accordance with § 180.415(b), and permanently marked near the test and inspection markings with a unique owner's identification number in letters and numbers at least 1/2 inch in height and width. (vii) Each nurse tank owner must maintain a copy of the test inspection report prepared by the inspector. The test report must contain the results of the test and meet the requirements in § 180.417(b) and be made available to a DOT representative upon request. (3) Field truck mounted tanks.

A cargo tank motor vehicle in other than metered delivery service must have a means to automatically shut off the flow of product without the need for human intervention within 20 seconds of an unintentional release caused by a complete separation of a liquid delivery hose (passive shut-down capability). (i) Designed flow of product through a bypass in the valve is acceptable when authorized by this subchapter. (ii) The design for the means to automatically shut off product flow must be certified by a Design Certifying Engineer. The certification must consider any specifications of the original component manufacturer and must explain how the passive means to shut off the flow of product operates. It must also outline the parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, types of product) within which the passive means to shut off the flow of product is designed to operate. All components of the discharge system that are integral to the design must be included in the certification. A copy of the design certification must be provided to the owner of the cargo tank motor vehicle on which the equipment will be installed. (iii) Installation must be performed under the supervision of a Registered Inspector unless the equipment is installed and removed as part of regular operation (e.g., a hose). The Registered Inspector must certify that the equipment is installed and tested, if it is possible to do so without damaging the equipment, in accordance with the Design Certifying Engineer's certification. The Registered Inspector must provide the certification to the owner of the cargo tank motor vehicle. (3) Cargo tank motor vehicles in metered delivery service. When required by the table in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, a cargo tank motor vehicle must have an off-truck remote means to close the internal self-closing stop valve and shut off all motive and auxiliary power equipment upon activation by a qualified person attending the unloading of the cargo tank motor vehicle (off-truck remote shut-off). It must function reliably at a distance of 45.72 m (150 feet). The off-truck remote shut-off activation device must not be capable of reopening the internal self-closing stop valve after emergency activation. (i) The emergency discharge control equipment must be installed under the supervision of a Registered Inspector. Each wireless transmitter/receiver must be tested to demonstrate that it will close the internal self-closing stop valve and shut off all motive and auxiliary power equipment at a distance of 91.44 m (300 feet) under optimum conditions. Emergency discharge control equipment that does not employ a wireless transmitter/receiver must be tested to demonstrate its functioning at the maximum length of the delivery hose. (ii) The Registered Inspector must certify that the remote control equipment is installed in accordance with the original component manufacturer's specifications and is tested in accordance with paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this section. The Registered Inspector must provide the owner of the cargo tank motor vehicle with this certification. (4) Query systems. When a transmitter/receiver system is used to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (n)(1)(v) of this section, it must close the internal self-closing stop valve and shut off all motive and auxiliary power equipment unless the qualified person attending the unloading operation prevents it from doing so at least once every five minutes. Testing and certification must be as specified in paragraph (n)(3) of this section. (5) Compliance dates. (i) Each specification MC 331 cargo tank motor vehicle with a certificate of construction issued two or more years after July 1, 1999, must have an appropriate emergency discharge control capability as specified in this paragraph (n).

This relief device must function at a pressure not exceeding the internal design pressure of the jacket, calculated in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 psig, whichever is less. (10) Tank inlet, outlet, pressure relief device and pressure control valve markings. (i) Each tank inlet and outlet, except pressure relief devices and pressure control valves, must be permanently marked to indicate whether it communicates with “vapor” or “liquid” when the tank is filled to the maximum permitted filling density. (ii) Each pressure relief valve must be plainly and permanently marked with the pressure, in psig, at which it is set-to-discharge, the discharge rate of the device in SCF per minute (SCFM) of free air, and the manufacturer's name or trade name and catalog number. The marked set-to-discharge pressure valve must be visible with the valve in its installed position. The rated discharge capacity of the device must be determined at a pressure of 120 percent of the design pressure of the tank. (iii) Each pressure control valve must be plainly and permanently marked with the pressure, in psig, at which it is set-to-discharge. (c) Weight of lading requirements. The weight of a cryogenic liquid in the tank must be determined by weighing or by the use of a liquid level gauging device authorized in § 178.338-14(a) of this subchapter, and may not exceed the lesser of: (1) The weight of lading in the tank, based on the water capacity stamped on the nameplate (§ 178.338-18(a)(4) of this subchapter) and the appropriate maximum permitted filling density specified in paragraph (f) of this section; or (2) The maximum weight of lading for which the cargo tank was designed, as marked on the specification plate (see § 178.338-18(b) of this subchapter). (d) Outage. Except for a cargo tank containing helium, cryogenic liquid, a cargo tank offered for transportation must have an outage of at least two percent below the inlet of the pressure relief device or pressure control valve, under conditions of incipient opening, with the tank in a level attitude. (e) Temperature. A flammable cryogenic liquid in a cargo tank at the start of travel must be at a temperature sufficiently cold that the pressure setting of the pressure control valve or the required pressure relief valve, whichever is lower, will not be reached in less time than the marked rated holding time for the cryogenic liquid (see paragraph (g)(3) of this section and § 178.338-9(b) of this subchapter). (f) Specification MC-338 (§ 178.338 of this subchapter) cargo tanks are authorized for the shipment of the following cryogenic liquids subject to the following additional requirements: (1) For purposes of this section, “filling density” is defined as the percent ratio of the weight of lading in the tank to the weight of water that the tank will hold at the design service temperature (one pound of water = 27.737 cubic inches at 60 °F., or one gallon of water = 231 cubic inches at 60 °F. and weighs 8.32828 pounds). (2) Air, argon, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen, cryogenic liquids must be loaded and shipped in accordance with the following table: (3) Carbon monoxide, hydrogen (minimum 95 percent para-hydrogen), ethylene, and methane or natural gas, cryogenic liquids must be loaded and shipped in accordance with the following table: (4) Mixtures of cryogenic liquid. Where charging requirements are not specifically prescribed in this paragraph (f), the cryogenic liquid must be shipped in packagings and under conditions approved by the Associate Administrator. (g) One-way travel time; marking. The jacket of a cargo tank to be used to transport a flammable cryogenic liquid must be marked on its right side near the front, in letters and numbers at least two inches high, “One-Way-Travel-Time __ hrs.”, with the blank filled in with a number indicating the one-way travel time (OWTT), in hours, of the cargo tank for the flammable cryogenic liquid to be transported. A cargo tank that is partially unloaded at one or more locations must have additional marking “One-Way-Travel-Time __ hrs. __ psig to __ psig at __ percent filling density,” with the second blank filled in with the pressure existing after partial unloading and the third blank filled in with the set-to-discharge pressure of the control valve or pressure relief valve, and the fourth blank with the filling density following partial unloading. Multiple OWTT markings for different pressure levels are permitted. The abbreviation “OWTT” may be used in place of the words “One-way-travel-time” in the marking required by this paragraph. (1) OWTT is based on the marked rated holding time (MRHT) of the cargo tank for the cryogenic liquid to be transported in the cargo tank. If the MRHT for the flammable cryogenic liquid is not displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate, this MRHT may be derived. (2) The MRHT is converted to OWTT, in hours, as follows: (i) For a tank with an MRHT of 72 hours or less, (ii) For a tank with an MRHT greater than 72 hours, (3) Each cargo tank motor vehicle used to transport a flammable cryogenic liquid must be examined after each shipment to determine its actual holding time. The record required by § 177.840(h) of this subchapter may be used for this determination. If the examination indicates that the actual holding time of the cargo tank, after adjustment to reflect an average ambient temperature of 85 °F, is less than 90 percent of the marked rated holding time (MRHT) for the cryogenic liquid marked on the specification plate or adjacent thereto (see § 178.338-18(b) of this subchapter), the tank may not be refilled with any flammable cryogenic liquid until it is restored to its marked rated holding time value or it is re-marked with the actual marked rated holding time determined by this examination. If the name of the flammable cryogenic liquid that was transported and its marked rated holding time is not displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate, this requirement may be met by deriving the MRHT of the cargo tank for that flammable cryogenic liquid and comparing that derived MRHT with the actual holding time after adjustment.

(c) In calculating A1 and A 2 values for approval in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section: (1) It is permissible to use an A 2 value calculated using a dose coefficient for the appropriate lung absorption type, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, if the chemical forms of each radionuclide under both normal and accident conditions of transport are taken into consideration. (2) A single radioactive decay chain in which the radionuclides are present in their naturally-occurring proportions, and in which no daughter nuclide has a half life either longer than 10 days or longer than that of the parent nuclide, will be considered as a single radionuclide, and the activity to be taken into account and the A 1 or A 2 value to be applied will be those corresponding to the parent nuclide of that chain. Otherwise, the parent and daughter nuclides will be considered as a mixture of different nuclides.

Each railroad operating a train carrying hazardous materials must at all times maintain in electronic form, off the train, accurate train consist information as required in § 174.26 of this subpart. Each railroad must make such electronic train consist information immediately accessible at all times to its designated emergency response point of contact such that they are able to communicate train consist information to Federal, State, and local first responders, emergency response officials, and law enforcement personnel seeking assistance. Each railroad must also provide, using electronic communication ( e.g., a software application or electronic data interchange, etc.), that electronic train consist information to authorized Federal, State, and local first responders, emergency response officials, and law enforcement personnel along the train route that could be or are involved in the response to, or investigation of, an accident, incident, or public health or safety emergency involving the rail transportation of hazardous materials such that the information is immediately available for use at the time it is needed. (b) Emergency notification. (1) General requirements. When a train carrying hazardous materials is involved in either an accident requiring response from local emergency response agencies, or in an incident involving the release or suspected release of a hazardous material from a rail car in the train requiring response from local emergency response agencies, the railroad must immediately notify the primary Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)— e.g., 9-1-1 call center—telephonically that is responsible for the area where the accident or incident occurred and must separately notify the track owner (should the railroad transporting the hazardous materials not be the track owner) and forward train consist information in electronic form to the PSAP and track owner in a form they are capable of readily accessing ( e.g., email, fax, software application, etc.). (2) Notification system test. At least annually, each railroad that operates trains carrying hazardous materials must test the notification system used to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. Railroads must: (i) Develop a testing protocol addressing frequency and locations to ensure reliability across all areas where the railroad operates trains carrying hazardous materials. (ii) Create a record of each system test that identifies at least the following information: (A) The date of the test; (B) The method used to provide the notification; (C) The name and location of the primary PSAP ( e.g., 9-1-1 call center) and/or track owner to whom the notification was sent; (D) Whether or not the test notification was received and acknowledged; and (E) For system tests that are not immediately received and acknowledged, an analysis of the contributing factors to the failure and corrective actions taken by the railroad to prevent such a failure from recurring. (iii) Retain test records for at least five years. (c) Class III railroad alternative compliance requirements. In place of the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a Class III railroad, as determined by the Surface Transportation Board under § 1201.1-1 of this title, transporting hazardous materials may comply with the alternative procedures in this paragraph to provide accurate train consist information to Federal, State, or local first responders, emergency response officials, and law enforcement personnel in the event of an incident, accident, or public health or safety emergency involving the rail transportation of hazardous materials. The Class III railroad must: (1) Develop a written plan that identifies the procedures for emergency notification and how the railroad will provide accurate train consist information in the event of an accident involving a train carrying hazardous materials requiring response from local emergency response agencies, or an incident involving the release or suspected release of a hazardous material from a rail car in the train requiring response from local emergency response agencies. This may be accomplished via the primary PSAP ( e.g., 9-1-1 call center) responsible for the area where the accident or incident occurred. The written plan must assign at least one person not on board the locomotive with the responsibility to provide accurate train consist information in addition to the train crew onboard the locomotive, unless there are no employees of the Class III railroad capable of fulfilling this function. (2) Notify emergency response organizations and primary PSAPs along their route about the contents of the written plan and any material changes to the plan made after the initial notification. (3) Enact the written plan when an accident involving a train carrying hazardous materials requiring response from local emergency response agencies, or an incident involving the release or suspected release of a hazardous material from a rail car in the train requiring response from local emergency response agencies occurs. The Class III railroad must provide immediate emergency notification telephonically to the primary PSAP ( e.g., 9-1-1 call center) responsible for the area where the accident or incident occurred, and provide accurate train consist information to appropriate entities based on their written plan. (4) Retain a copy of this written plan at the Class III railroad's primary place of business and provide a copy to authorized representatives of the Department upon request. (5) Conduct a test, at least annually, of the procedures for emergency notification and transmission of accurate train consist information. Each Class III railroad must create a record of the test that includes at least the following information: (i) The date of the test; (ii) A brief description of the method of emergency notification and transmission of train consist information; (iii) The name and location of the recipient of the emergency notification and train consist information; (iv) Whether or not the test was successful in providing emergency notification and train consist information to the intended recipient; (v) For unsuccessful tests, an analysis of the contributing factors to the failure and corrective actions taken by the railroad to prevent such a failure from recurring. (6) Retain test records required in paragraph (c)(5) of this section for at least five years. (d) Security measures. Each railroad must implement security and confidentiality protections in generating, updating, providing, and forwarding train consist information in electronic or other form pursuant to this section to ensure they provide access only to authorized persons. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit a railroad from entering into agreements with other railroads or persons to develop and implement a secure process for generating, updating, providing, and forwarding that information. (e) Provision of train consist information. No railroad may withhold, or cause to be withheld, the train consist information described in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section from Federal, State, or local first responders, emergency response officials, and law enforcement personnel in the event of an incident, accident, or public health or safety emergency involving the rail transportation of hazardous materials. If a railroad uses a software application to meet the requirements of this section, it must provide all first responders, emergency response officials, and law enforcement personnel responding to, or investigating, an accident, incident, or public health or safety emergency involving the rail transportation of hazardous materials access, in accordance with the security and confidentiality protections required in paragraph (d), to the train consist information contained within that application without delay for the duration of the response or investigation."},{"part":"174","section":"174.50","subject":"Nonconforming or leaking packages.","type":"modal","fullText":"A leaking non-bulk package may not be forwarded until repaired, reconditioned, or overpacked in accordance with § 173.3 of this subchapter.

(1) Unloading operations must be performed by hazmat employees properly instructed in unloading hazardous materials and made responsible for compliance with this section. (2) Each hazmat employee who is responsible for unloading must apply the handbrake and block at least one wheel to prevent motion in any direction. If multiple tank cars are coupled together, sufficient hand brakes must be set and wheels blocked to prevent motion in both directions. (3) Each hazmat employee who is responsible for unloading must secure access to the track to prevent entry by other rail equipment, including motorized service vehicles. This requirement may be satisfied by lining each switch providing access to the unloading area against motion and securing each switch with an effective locking device, or by using derails, portable bumper blocks, or other equipment that provides an equivalent level of safety. (4) Each hazmat employee who is responsible for unloading must display caution signs on the track or on the tank cars to warn persons approaching the cars from the open end of the track and must be left up until after all closures are secured and the cars are in proper condition for transportation. The caution signs must be of metal or other durable material, rectangular, at 30.48 cm (12 inches) high by 38.10 cm (15 inches) wide, and bear the word “STOP.” The word “STOP” must appear in letters at least 10.16 cm (4 inches) high. The letters must be white on a blue background. Additional words, such as “Tank Car Connected” or “Crew at Work,” may also appear in white letters under the word “STOP.” (5) The transloading facility operator must maintain written safety procedures (such as those it may already be required to maintain pursuant to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements in 29 CFR 1910.119 and 1910.120) in a location where they are immediately available to hazmat employees responsible for the transloading operation. (6) Before a manhole cover or outlet valve cap is removed from a tank car, the car must be relieved of all interior pressure by cooling the tank with water or by venting the tank by raising the safety valve or opening the dome vent at short intervals. However, if venting to relieve pressure will cause a dangerous amount of vapor to collect outside the car, venting and unloading must be deferred until the pressure is reduced by allowing the car to stand overnight, otherwise cooling the contents, or venting to a closed collection system. These precautions are not necessary when the car is equipped with a manhole cover which hinges inward or with an inner manhole cover which does not have to be removed to unload the car, and when pressure is relieved by piping vapor into a condenser or storage tank. (b) After the pressure is released, for unloading processes that require the removal of the manhole cover, the seal must be broken and the manhole cover removed as follows: (1) Screw type. The cover must be loosened by placing a bar between the manhole cover lug and knob. After two complete turns, so that the vent openings are exposed, the operation must be stopped, and if there is any sound of escaping vapor, the cover must be screwed down tightly and the interior pressure relieved as prescribed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, before again attempting to remove the cover. (2) Hinged and bolted type. All nuts must be unscrewed one complete turn, after which same precautions as prescribed for screw type cover must be observed. (3) Interior type. All dirt and cinders must be carefully removed from around the cover before the yoke is unscrewed. (c) When the car is unloaded through a bottom outlet valve, for unloading processes that require the removal of the manhole cover, the manhole cover must be adjusted as follows: (1) Screw type. The cover must be put in place, but not entirely screwed down, so that air may enter the tank through the vent holes in threaded flange of the cover. (2) Hinged and bolted type. A non-metallic block must be placed under one edge of the cover. (3) Interior type. The screw must be tightened up in the yoke so that the cover is brought up within one-half inch of the closed position. (d) When unloading through the bottom outlet of a car equipped with an interior manhole type cover, and in each case where unloading is done through the manhole (unless a special cover with a safety vent opening and a tight connection for the discharge outlet is used), the manhole must be protected by asbestos or metal covers against the entrance of sparks or other sources of ignition of vapor, or by being covered and surrounded with wet burlap or similar cloth material. The burlap or other cloth must be kept damp by the replacement or the application of water as needed. (e) Seals or other substances must not be thrown into the tank and the contents may not be spilled over the car or tank. (f) The valve rod handle or control in the dome must be operated several times to see that outlet valve in bottom of tank is on its seat before valve cap is removed. (g) The valve cap, or the reducer when a large outlet is to be used, must be removed with a suitable wrench after the set screws are loosened and a pail must be placed in position to catch any liquid that may be in the outlet chamber. If the valve cap or reducer does not unscrew easily, it may be tapped lightly with a mallet or wooden block in an upward direction. If leakage shows upon starting the removal, the cap or reducer may not be entirely unscrewed. Sufficient threads must be left engaged and sufficient time allowed to permit the controlled escape of any accumulation of liquid in the outlet chamber. If the leakage stops or the rate of leakage diminishes materially, the cap or reducer may be entirely removed. If the initial rate of leakage continues, further efforts must be made to seat the outlet valve (see paragraph (f) of this section). If this fails, the cap or reducer must be screwed up tight and the tank must be unloaded through the dome. If upon removal of the outlet cap the outlet chamber is found to be blocked with frozen liquid or any other matter, the cap must be replaced immediately and a careful examination must be made to determine whether the outlet casting has been cracked. If the obstruction is not frozen liquid, the car must be unloaded through the dome. If the obstruction is frozen liquid and no crack has been found in the outlet casting, the car may, if circumstances require it, be unloaded from the bottom by removing the cap and attaching unloading connections immediately. Before opening the valve inside the tank car with a frozen liquid blockage: (1) Steam must be applied to the outside of the outlet casting or the outlet casting must be wrapped with burlap or other rags and hot water applied to the wrapped casting to melt the frozen liquid; or (2) For combustible liquid or Class 3 liquid petroleum distillate fuels, the blockage may be cleared by attaching a fitting to the outlet line and applying nitrogen at a pressure not to exceed 100 psig. (h) Unloading connections must be securely attached to unloading pipes on the dome or to the bottom discharge outlets before any discharge valves are opened. (i) Throughout the entire period of unloading and while a tank car has unloading equipment attached, the facility operator must assure that the tank car is: (1) Attended by a designated hazmat employee who is physically present and who has an unobstructed view of the unloading operation; or (2) Monitored by a signaling system ( e.g., video system, sensing equipment, or mechanical equipment) that is observed by a designated hazmat employee located either in the immediate area of the tank car or at a remote location within the facility, such as a control room. The signaling system must— (i) Provide a level of surveillance equivalent to that provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (i); and (ii) Provide immediate notification to a designated hazmat employee of any system malfunction or other emergency so that, if warranted, responsive actions may be initiated immediately. (j) Attendance is not required when piping is attached to a top outlet of a tank car, equipped with a protective housing required under § 179.100-12 of this subchapter, for discharge of lading under the following conditions: (1) All valves are tightly closed. (2) The piping is not connected to hose or other unloading equipment and is fitted with a cap or plug of appropriate material and construction. (3) The piping extends no more than 15.24 centimeters (6 inches) from the outer edge of the protective housing. (k) In the absence of the unloader, a tank car may stand with unloading connections attached when no product is being transferred under the following conditions: (1) The facility operator must designate a hazmat employee responsible for on-site monitoring of the transfer facility. The designated hazmat employee must be made familiar with the nature and properties of the product contained in the tank car; procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency; and, in the event of an emergency, have the ability and authority to take responsible actions. (2) When a signaling system is used in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, the system must be capable of alerting the designated hazmat employee in the event of an emergency and providing immediate notification of any monitoring system malfunction. If the monitoring system does not have self-monitoring capability, the designated hazmat employee must check the monitoring system hourly for proper operation. (3) The tank car and facility shutoff valves must be secured in the closed position. (4) Brakes must be set and wheels locked in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (5) Access to the track must be secured in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (l) As soon as a tank car is completely unloaded, all valves must be made tight by the use of a bar, wrench or other suitable tool, the unloading connections must be removed and all other closures made tight. (m) Railroad defect cards may not be removed. (n) If oil or gasoline has been spilled on the ground around connections, it must be covered with fresh, dry sand or dirt. (o) All tools and implements used in connection with unloading must be kept free of oil, dirt, and grit.

(iii) “3” means any combination of explosives from compatibility group C, D, or E with those in compatibility group N is assigned to compatibility group D. (iv) “4” means detonators and detonating primers, Division 1.4S (explosives), may not be loaded in the same car with Division 1.1 and 1.2 (explosive) materials. (v) “5” means Division 1.4S fireworks may not be loaded in the same car with Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials. (vi) “6” means explosive articles in compatibility group G, other than fireworks and those requiring special stowage, may be loaded and transported with articles of compatibility groups C, D and E, provided no explosive substances are carried in the same rail car. (h) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, explosives of the same compatibility group but of different divisions may be transported together provided that the whole shipment is transported as though its entire contents were of the lower numerical division (i.e., Division 1.1 being lower than Division 1.2). For example, a mixed shipment of Division 1.2 (explosive) materials and Division 1.4 (explosive) materials, compatibility group D, must be transported as Division 1.2 (explosive) materials. (i) When Division 1.5 materials, compatibility group D are transported in the same freight container as Division 1.2 (explosive) materials, compatibility group D, the shipment must be transported as Division 1.1 (explosive) materials, compatibility group D.

(b) Each rail car used for transporting Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials must meet the following requirements as applicable: (1) The car must be equipped with air brakes, hand brakes, and roller bearings which are in condition for service. (2) The car may not have any holes or cracks in the roof, sides, ends, or doors through which sparks may enter, or unprotected decayed spots which may hold sparks and start a fire. (3) The roof of the car must be carefully inspected from the outside for decayed spots, especially under or near the running board, and such spots must be covered or repaired to prevent their holding fire from sparks. A car with a roof generally decayed, even if tight, may not be used. (4) The doors must close tightly so that sparks cannot get in at the joints, and, if necessary to achieve this degree of tightness, the doors must be stripped. The stripping should be placed on the inside and fastened to the door frames where it will form a shoulder against which the closed doors are pressed by means of wedges or cleats in door shoes or keepers. The openings under the doors should be similarly closed. The hasp fastenings must be examined with the doors closed and fastened, and the doors must be cleated when necessary to prevent them from shifting. When the car is opened for any reason, the wedges or cleats must be replaced before car containing Class 1 (explosive) materials is permitted to proceed. (5) The roller bearings and the trucks must be carefully examined and put in such condition as to reduce to a minimum the danger of hotboxes or other failure necessitating the setting out of the car before reaching its destination. (6) The car must be carefully swept out before it is loaded. For less-than-carload shipments the space in which the packages are to be loaded must be carefully swept. If evidence of a potential hazardous residue is apparent after the floor has been swept, the carrier must either decontaminate the car or provide a suitable substitute car. (7) Any holes in the floor or lining must be repaired and special care taken that there are no projecting nails or bolts or exposed pieces of metal which may work loose or produce holes in packages of Class 1 (explosive) materials during transit. Protruding nails in the floor or lining which have worked loose must be drawn, and if necessary for the purpose of fastening the floor or lining, new nails must be driven through other parts thereof. (8) Metal floor plates must be completely covered with wood, plywood, or fiber or composition sheets of adequate thickness and strength to prevent contact of the floor plates with the packages of Class 1 (explosive) materials under conditions incident to transportation, except that the covering of metal floor plates is not necessary for carload shipments loaded by the Department of Defense provided the Class 1 (explosive) materials are of such nature that they are not liable to leakage of dust, powder, or vapor which might become the cause of an explosion. (9) If the car is equipped with automobile loading devices, it may not be used unless the loading device is securely attached to the roof of the car with fastenings supplementing those already provided and so fixed that it cannot fall. (10) The car must be equipped with high-friction composition brake shoes (except metal deck flat cars used for COFC/TOFC service may be equipped with high phosphorus cast iron brakeshoes) and brake rigging designed for this type of brake shoe. Each brake shoe on the car must be at least 1 cm (0.4 inch) thick, and in safe and suitable condition for service. (11) The car must have either a metal subfloor with no combustible material exposed beneath the car, or metal spark shields extending from center sill to side sills and from end sills to at least 30 cm (12 inches) beyond the extreme treads of the inside wheels of each truck, which are tightly fitted against the subfloor so that there is no vacant space or combustible material exposed. The metal subfloor or spark shields may not have an accumulation of oil, grease, or other debris which could support combustion.

This certification shall be made on the first signature line in Car Certificate No. 2 on the form prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, the finished load must be inspected and certified to be in compliance with the requirements of this part by a qualified person designated under § 215.11 of this title before the car goes forward. This certification shall be made on the second signature line in Car Certificate No. 2 on the form prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section. If the loading is performed by the carrier, Car Certificate No. 2 may only be signed by a qualified person designated under § 215.11 of this title. (e) If a trailer or container containing Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials is loaded on a flatcar, the loading and securing of the load on the car must be supervised by a representative of the shipper or carrier. The certification shall be made in Car Certificate No. 3 on the form prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section. (f) Each car certificate for use in connection with the inspection of rail cars for the carriage of Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials shall be printed on strong tag board measuring 18 by 18 cm (7.1 by 7.1 inches) or 15 by 20 cm (5.9 by 7.9 inches). It must be duly executed in triplicate by the carrier, and by the shipper if he loads the shipments. The original must be filed by the carrier at the forwarding station in a separate file and the other two must be attached to the car, one to each outer side on a fixed placard board or as otherwise provided.

This part prescribes additional requirements with respect to the stowage of specific hazardous materials in addition to those authorized in § 172.101 of this subchapter. This section sets forth the basic physical requirements for the authorized locations. Hazardous materials offered for transport as limited quantities are allocated stowage category A and are not subject to any of the specific stowage requirements indicated in column 10B in § 172.101 of this subchapter for the material being transported. (b) To qualify as “on deck” stowage, the location must be on the weather deck. If the location is in a house on the weather deck, the location must have a permanent structural opening to the atmosphere, such as a door, hatch, companionway or manhole, and must be vented to the atmosphere. The location may not have any structural opening to any living quarters, cargo, or other compartment unless the opening has means for being closed off and secured. Any deck house containing living quarters, a steering engine, a refrigerating unit, a refrigerated stowage box, or a heating unit may not be used unless that area is isolated from the cargo stowage area by a permanent, and tight, metallic bulkhead. Stowage in a shelter or 'tween deck is not considered to be “on deck”. A barge that is vented to the atmosphere and is stowed on deck on a barge-carrying ship is considered to be “on deck”. When an entry in § 172.101 of this subchapter requires “on-deck” stowage and is qualified by the requirement “protected from sources of heat”, the stowage must be protected from the direct rays of the sun by means of structural erections or awnings except that such protection is not required for shipment in portable tanks. (c) To qualify as “under deck” stowage, the location must be in a hold or compartment below the weather deck capable of being ventilated and allotted entirely to the carriage of cargo. It must be bounded by permanent steel decks and bulkheads or the shell of the vessel. The deck openings must have means for effectively closing the hold or compartment against the weather, and in the case of superimposed holds, for effectively closing off each hold. A hold or compartment containing a crew passage formed by battens or by mesh or wire screen bulkhead may not be used for the stowage of any hazardous material unless a watchman is provided for this area. (d) To qualify as “under deck away from heat”, the location must be under deck and have built-in means for ventilation. If it is subject to heat from any artificial source, it only qualifies for the stowage of those hazardous materials for which “under deck” stowage is authorized. (e) Notwithstanding the stowage provisions given in the table in § 172.101 of this subchapter, empty packages containing residue, including IBCs and large packages, may be stowed “on deck” or “under deck” in a mechanically ventilated cargo space. However, empty pressure receptacles containing residue that carry a label of class 2.3 must be stowed “on deck” and waste aerosols must be stowed in accordance with the table in § 172.101 of this subchapter. (f) Stowage of containers on board hatchless container ships. (1) Containers holding a hazardous material may be stowed in or vertically above a hatchless container hold if the following conditions are met: (1) All hazardous materials are permitted for under deck stowage as specified in the Table in § 172.101 of this subchapter; and (2) The hatchless container hold is in full compliance with the provisions of SOLAS, Chapter II-2/Regulation 19 (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), applicable to enclosed container cargo spaces, as appropriate for the cargo transported."},{"part":"176","section":"176.65","subject":"Alternative stowage procedures.","type":"modal","fullText":"When a hazardous material is to be loaded on board a vessel and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard Captain of the Port for the place where the vessel is being loaded that it is impracticable to comply with a stowage location requirement specified in the § 172.101 table of this subchapter or a segregation, handling or stowage requirement specified in this part, the Captain of the Port may authorize in writing the use of an alternative stowage location or method of segregation, handling or stowage subject to such conditions as he finds will insure a level of safety at least equal to that afforded by the regulatory requirement concerned."},{"part":"176","section":"176.69","subject":"General stowage requirements for hazardous materials.","type":"modal","fullText":"(a) Hazardous materials (except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and Class 9 (miscellaneous hazardous) materials) must be stowed in a manner that will facilitate inspection during the voyage, their removal from a potentially dangerous situation, and the removal of packages in case of fire.

Otherwise, the transport vehicle or container must be transported “on deck.” (f) A hazardous material may be carried on board a vessel in a portable tank subject to the following conditions: (1) Small passenger vessels of 100 gross tons, or less, may carry a hazardous material in a portable tank only when 16 or less passengers are on board and only when specifically authorized by the Officer-in-Charge, Marine Inspection, by endorsement of the vessel's Certificate of Inspection. (2) Portable tanks containing flammable liquids or gases, combustible liquids with flashpoints below 60 °C (140 °F). that are insoluble in water, or organic peroxides, spontaneously combustible materials, or water reactive materials must be stowed on deck irrespective of the stowage authorized in § 172.101 of this subchapter. Portable tanks containing hazardous materials not restricted to on deck stowage by the previous sentence must be stowed in accordance with the requirements specified in § 172.101 of this subchapter. (3) Aluminum, magnesium, and their alloys are specifically prohibited as materials of construction of portable tanks. (g) Cryogenic liquids. For shipment of cryogenic liquids on board a vessel the packaging must be designed and filled so that: (1) Any cryogenic liquid being transported in a cargo tank, regardless of the pressure in the package, must be contained in a steel jacketed Specification MC-338 (§ 178.338 of this subchapter) insulated cargo tank. (2) Any valve or fitting with moving or abrading parts that may come in contact with any cryogenic liquid may not be made of aluminum. (3) For a flammable cryogenic liquid being transported in a cargo tank, the elapsed time between the loading of the cargo tank and the subsequent unloading of the cargo tank at its final destination may not exceed the marked rated holding time (MRHT) of the cargo tank for the cryogenic liquid being transported, which must be displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate. (4) Portable tanks, cargo tanks, and tank cars containing cryogenic liquids must be stowed “on deck” regardless of the stowage authorized in § 172.101 of this subchapter. Cargo tanks or tank cars containing cryogenic liquids may be stowed one deck below the weather deck when transported on a trailership or trainship that is unable to provide “on deck” stowage because of the vessel's design. Tank cars must be Class DOT-113 or AAR-204W tank cars. (h) A fumigated cargo transport unit may only be transported on board a vessel subject to the following conditions and limitations: (1) The fumigated cargo transport unit may be placed on board a vessel only if at least 24 hours have elapsed since the unit was last fumigated; (2) The fumigated cargo transport unit is accompanied by a document showing the date of fumigation and the type and amount of fumigant used; (3) Prior to loading, the master is informed of the intended placement of the fumigated cargo transport unit on board the vessel and the information provided on the accompanying document; (4) Equipment that is capable of detecting the fumigant and instructions for the equipment's use is provided on the vessel; (5) The fumigated cargo transport unit must be stowed at least 5 m from any opening to accommodation spaces; (6) Fumigated cargo transport units may only be transported on deck on vessels carrying more than 25 passengers; and (7) Fumigants may not be added to cargo transport units while on board a vessel. (i) A cargo transport unit packed or loaded with flammable gas or flammable liquid having a flashpoint below + 23 °C transported on deck must be stowed “away from” possible sources of ignition. In the case of container ships, a distance equivalent to one container space athwartships away from possible sources of ignition applied in any direction will satisfy this requirement.

A power-operated truck (including a power-operated tractor, forklift, or other specialized truck used for cargo handling) may not be used on board a vessel in a space containing a hazardous material unless the truck conforms to the requirements of this section. The COTP may suspend or prohibit the use of cargo handling vehicles or equipment when that use constitutes a safety hazard. (b) Each truck must have a specific designation of Underwriter's Laboratories or Factory Mutual Laboratories. Any repair or alteration to a truck must be equivalent to that required on the original designation. (c) Description of designations. The recognized testing laboratory type designations are as follows: (1) An “E” designated unit is an electrically-powered unit that has minimum acceptable safeguards against inherent fire hazards. (2) An “EE” designated unit is an electrically-powered unit that has, in addition to all the requirements for the “E” unit, the electric motor and all other electrical equipment completely enclosed. (3) An “EX” designated unit is an electrically-powered unit that differs from the “E” and “EE” unit in that the electrical fittings and equipment are so designed, constructed, and assembled that the unit may be used in certain atmospheres containing flammable vapors or dusts. (4) A “G” designated unit is a gasoline-powered unit having minimum acceptable safeguards against inherent fire hazards. (5) A “GS” designated unit is a gasoline-powered unit that is provided with additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel, and electrical systems.

(2) A power-operated truck designated LPS, GS, D, or DS may be used under conditions acceptable to the COTP. (e) Other hazardous materials. (1) Only an “EX”, “EE”, “GS”, “LPA”, or “DS” truck may be used in a hold or compartment containing Division 2.1 (flammable gas) materials, Class 3 (flammable liquids), Class 4 (flammable solids) materials, or Class 5 (oxidizers or organic peroxides) materials, cottons or other vegetable fibers, or bulk sulfur. (2) Only a designated truck may be used to handle any other hazardous material not covered in paragraph (d) or (e)(1) of this section. (f) Minimum safety features. In addition to the construction and design safety features required, each truck must have at least the following minimum safety features: (1) The truck must be equipped with a warning horn, whistle, gong, or other device that may be heard clearly above normal shipboard noises. (2) When the truck operation may expose the operator to danger from a falling object, the truck must be equipped with a driver's overhead guard. When the overall height of the truck with forks in the lowered position is limited by head room the overhead guard may be omitted. This overhead guard is only intended to offer protection from impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, or similar hazards. (3) A forklift truck used to handle small objects or unstable loads must be equipped with a load backrest extension having height, width, and strength sufficient to prevent any load, or part of it, from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum backward tilt. The load backrest extension must be constructed in a manner that does not interfere with good visibility. (4) The forks on a fork lift truck must be secured to the carriage so as to prevent any unintentional lifting of the toe which could create a hazard. The forks may not display permanent deformation when subjected to a test load of three times the rated capacity. (5) Each fork extension or other attachment must be secured to prevent unintentional lifting or displacement on primary forks. (6) Tires extending beyond the confines of the truck shall be provided with a guard to prevent the tires from throwing particles at the operator. (7) Unless the steering mechanism is a type that prevents road reactions from causing the steering handwheel to spin, a mushroom type steering knob must be used to engage the palm of the operator's hand, or the steering mechanism must be arranged in some other manner to prevent injury. The knob must be mounted within the perimeter of the wheel. (8) All steering controls must be confined within the clearnace of the truck or guarded so that moving of the controls will not result in injury to the operator when passing stanchions, obstructions or other. (g) Special operating conditions. (1) A truck may not be used on board a vessel unless prior notification of its use is given to the master or senior deck officer on board. (2) Before a truck is operated on board a vessel, it must be in a safe operating condition as determined by the master or senior deck officer on board. (3) Any truck that emits sparks or flames from the exhaust system must immediately be removed from service and may not be returned to service until the cause of these sparks or flames has been eliminated. (4)-(5) [Reserved] (6) All truck motors must be shut off immediately when a breakage or leakage of packages containing flammable liquids or gases, flammable solids, oxidizers, or organic peroxides occurs or is discovered. (7) The rated capacity of the truck must be posted on the truck at all times in a conspicuous place. This capacity may not be exceeded. (8) At least one Coast Guard approved marine type size 1 Type B, or UL approved 5BC portable fire extinguisher, or its approved equivalent, must be affixed to the truck in a readily accessible position or must be kept in close proximity, available for immediate use. (9) The vessel's fire fighting equipment, both fixed (where installed) and portable, must be kept ready for immediate use in the vicinity of the space being worked. (h) Refueling. (1) A truck using gasoline as fuel may not be refueled in the hold or on the weather deck of a vessel unless a portable non-spilling fuel handling system of not over five gallons capacity is used. Gasoline may not be transferred to a portable non-spilling fuel handling device on board the vessel. (2) A truck using liquefied petroleum gas as fuel may not be refueled in the hold or on the weather deck of a vessel unless it is fitted with a removable tank and the hand-operated shutoff valve of the depleted tank is closed. In addition, the motor must be run until it stalls from lack of fuel and then the hand-operated shut off valve closed before the quick disconnect fitting to the fuel tank is disconnected. (3) A truck using diesel oil as fuel may not be refueled on the weather deck or in the hold of a vessel unless a portable container of not over a five gallon capacity is used. A truck may be refueled or a portable container may be refilled from a larger container of diesel fuel on the weather deck of a vessel if a suitable pump is used for the transfer operation and a drip pan of adequate size is used to prevent any dripping of fuel on the deck. (4) Refueling must be performed under the direct supervision of an experienced and responsible person specifically designated for this duty by the person in charge of the loading or unloading of the vessel. (5) Refueling may not be undertaken with less than two persons specifically assigned and present for the complete operation, at least one of whom must be experienced in using the portable fire extinguishers required in the fuel area. (6) At least one Coast Guard approved marine type size 1 Type B or UL approved 5BC portable fire extinguisher or its approved equivalent, must be provided in the fueling area. This is in addition to the extinguisher required by paragraph (g)(8) of this section. (7) The location for refueling trucks must be designated by the master or senior deck officer on board the vessel. “NO SMOKING” signs must be conspicuously posted in the area. (8) The location designated for refueling must be adequately ventilated to insure against accumulation of any hazardous concentration of vapors. (9) Before any truck in a hold is refueled or before any fuel handling device or unmounted liquefied petroleum gas cylinder is placed in a hold, the motors of all trucks in the same hold must be stopped. (10) All fuel handling devices and unmounted liquefied petroleum gas containers must be removed from a hold before any truck motor is started and the trucks are placed in operation in that hold. (i) Replacing batteries. Batteries for electrically powered trucks and for the ignition systems of internal combustion powered trucks may be changed in the hold of a vessel subject to the following conditions: (1) Only suitable handling equipment may be employed. (2) Adequate precautions must be taken to avoid damage to the battery, short circuiting of the battery, and spillage of the electrolyte. (j) Charging of batteries. Batteries of industrial trucks may be recharged in a hold of a vessel subject to the following conditions: (1) The batteries must be housed in a suitable, ventilated, portable metal container with a suitable outlet at the top for connection of a portable air hose, or must be placed directly beneath a suitable outlet at the top for connection of a portable air hose. The air hose must be permanently connected to an exhaust duct leading to the open deck and terminate in a gooseneck or other suitable weather head. If natural ventilation is not practicable or adequate, mechanical means of exhaust must be employed in conjunction with the duct. The air outlet on the battery container must be equipped with an interlock switch so arranged that the charging of the battery cannot take place unless the air hose is properly connected to the box. (2) If mechanical ventilation is used, an additional interlock must be provided between the fan and the charging circuit so that the fan must be in operation in order to complete the charging circuit for operation. It is preferable that this interlock switch be of a centrifugal type driven by the fan shaft. (3) The hold may not contain any hazardous materials. (4) The charging facilities may be part of the truck equipment or may be separate from the truck and located inside or outside the cargo hold. The power supply or charging circuit (whichever method is used) must be connected to the truck by a portable plug connection of the break-away type. This portable plug must be so engaged with the truck battery charging outlet that any movement of the truck away from the charging station will break the connection between the plug and receptacle without exposing any live parts to contact with a conducting surface or object and without the plug falling to the deck where it may become subject to damage. (5) All unmounted batteries must be suitably protected or removed from an area in the hold of the vessel before any truck is operated in that area. (k) Stowage of power-operated industrial trucks on board a vessel. Trucks stowed on board a vessel must meet vessel stowage requirements in § 176.905. (l) Packaging and stowage of fuel on board a vessel. Division 2.1 (flammable gas) materials and flammable liquids used as fuel for industrial trucks must be packaged and stowed as authorized in 46 CFR 147.60 or 46 CFR 147.45, respectively."},{"part":"176","section":"176.80","subject":"Applicability.","type":"modal","fullText":"(a) This subpart sets forth segregation requirements in addition to any segregation requirements set forth elsewhere in this subchapter. (b) Hazardous materials in limited quantities when loaded in transport vehicles and freight containers, are excepted from the segregation requirements of this subpart and any additional segregation specified in this subchapter for transportation by vessel; except that articles of division 1.4, compatibility group S, shall not be stowed in the same compartment or hold, or cargo transport unit with hazardous materials of Class 1 of compatibility groups A and L."},{"part":"176","section":"176.83","subject":"Segregation.","type":"modal","fullText":"(a) General. (1) The requirements of this section apply to all cargo spaces on deck or under deck of all types of vessels, and to all cargo transport units. (2) Segregation is obtained by maintaining certain distances between incompatible hazardous materials or by requiring the presence of one or more steel bulkheads or decks between them or a combination thereof. Intervening spaces between such hazardous materials may be filled with other cargo which is not incompatible with the hazardous materials. (3) The general requirements for segregation between the various classes of dangerous goods are shown in the segregation table. In addition to these general requirements, there may be a need to segregate a particular material from other materials which would contribute to its hazard. Such segregation requirements are indicated by code numbers in Column 10B of the § 172.101 Table. (4) Segregation is not required: (i) Between hazardous materials of different classes which comprise the same substance but vary only in their water content (for example, sodium sulfide in Division 4.2 or Class 8) or quantity for Class 7 materials; or (ii) Between hazardous materials of different classes which comprise a group of substances that do not react dangerously with each other. The following materials are grouped by compatibility: (A) Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions with not less than 8 percent but less than 20 percent hydrogen peroxide (stabilized as necessary); Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide; Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions with more than 40 percent but not more than 60 percent hydrogen peroxide; Hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid mixtures, stabilized with acids, water and not more than 5 percent peroxyacetic acid; Organic peroxide type D, liquid; Organic peroxide type E, liquid; Organic peroxide type F, liquid; (B) Dichlorosilane, Silicon tetrachloride, and Trichlorosilane; and (C) Organometallic substance, solid, pyrophoric; Organometallic substance, liquid, pyrophoric; Organometallic substance, solid, pyrophoric, water-reactive; Organometallic substance, liquid, pyrophoric, water-reactive; Organometallic substance, solid, water-reactive; Organometallic substance, solid, water-reactive, flammable; Organometallic substance, solid, water-reactive, self-heating; Organometallic substance, liquid, water-reactive; Organometallic substance, liquid, water-reactive, flammable; and Organometallic substance, solid, self-heating. (5) Whenever hazardous materials are stowed together, whether or not in a cargo transport unit, the segregation of such hazardous materials from others must always be in accordance with the most restrictive requirements for any of the hazardous materials concerned. (6) When the § 172.101 Table or § 172.402 requires packages to bear a subsidiary hazard label or labels, the segregation appropriate to the subsidiary hazards must be applied when that segregation is more restrictive than that required by the primary hazard. For the purposes of this paragraph, the segregation requirements corresponding to an explosive subsidiary hazard are—except for organic peroxides which are those corresponding to Division 1.3—those for Division 1.4 (explosive) materials. (7) Where, for the purposes of segregation, terms such as “away from” a particular hazard class are used in the § 172.101 Table, the segregation requirement applies to: (i) All hazardous materials within the hazard class; and (ii) All hazardous materials for which a secondary hazard label of that class is required. (8) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section, hazardous materials of the same class may be stowed together without regard to segregation required by secondary hazards (subsidiary risk label(s)), provided the substances do not react dangerously with each other and cause: (i) Combustion and/or evolution of considerable heat; (ii) Evolution of flammable, toxic or asphyxiant gases; (iii) The formation of corrosive substances; or (iv) The formation of unstable substances. (9) Stowage in a shelter-'tween deck cargo space is not considered to be “on deck” stowage. (10) Where the code in column (10B) of the § 172.101 Table specifies that “Segregation as for. . .” applies, the segregation requirements applicable to that class in the § 176.83(b) General Segregation Table must be applied. However, for the purposes of paragraph (a)(8) of this section, which permits substances of the same class to be stowed together provided they do not react dangerously with each other, the segregation requirements of the class as represented by the primary hazard class in the § 172.101 Table entry must be applied. (11) Certain exceptions from segregation for waste cyanides or waste cyanide mixtures or solutions transported with acids; waste Division 4.2 materials transported with Class 8 liquids; and waste Division 6.1 Packing Group I, Hazard Zone A material transported with waste Class 3 material, Class 8 liquids, and Division 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 or 5.2 material are set forth in § 173.12(e) of this subchapter. (b) General Segregation Table. The following table sets forth the general requirements for segregation between the various classes (divisions) of hazardous materials. Certain divisions are listed as separate hazard classes for the purpose of this table ( e.g. , “2.1” and “2.2”). The properties of materials within each class may vary greatly and may require greater segregation than is reflected in this table. If the § 172.101 Table sets forth particular requirements for segregation, they take precedence over these general requirements. (c) Segregation requirements for breakbulk cargo. (1) The requirements of this paragraph apply to the segregation of packages containing hazardous materials and stowed as breakbulk cargo; (2) Definition of the segregation terms: (i) Legend: (A) Package containing incompatible goods. (B) Reference package. (C) Deck resistant to fire and liquid. Full vertical lines represent transverse bulkheads between compartments or holds resistant to fire and liquid. (ii) “Away from”: Effectively segregated so that the incompatible materials cannot interact dangerously in the event of an accident but may be carried in the same compartment or hold or on deck provided a minimum horizontal separation of 3 m (10 feet) projected vertically is obtained. (iii) “Separated From”: In different compartments or holds when stowed under deck. If the intervening deck is resistant to fire and liquid, a vertical separation (i.e., in different compartments) is acceptable as equivalent to this segregation. For “on deck” stowage, this segregation means a separation by a distance of at least 6 m (20 feet) horizontally. (iv) “ Separated by a complete compartment or hold from ”: Either a vertical or horizontal separation. If the intervening decks are not resistant to fire and liquid, then only a longitudinal separation (i.e., by an intervening complete compartment or hold) is acceptable. For “on deck” stowage, this segregation means a separation by a distance of at least 12 m (39 feet) horizontally. The same distance must be applied if one package is stowed “on deck”, and the other one in an upper compartment. One of the two decks must be resistant to fire and liquid. (v) “ Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete compartment or hold from ”: Vertical separation alone does not meet this requirement. Between a package “under deck” and one “on deck” a minimum distance of 24 m (79 feet) including a complete compartment must be maintained longitudinally. For “on deck” stowage, this segregation means a separation by a distance of at least 24 m (79 feet) longitudinally. (d) Segregation in cargo transport units: Two hazardous materials for which any segregation is required may not be stowed in the same cargo transport unit. (e) Segregation of hazardous materials stowed as breakbulk cargo from those packed in cargo transport units: (1) Hazardous materials stowed as breakbulk cargo must be segregated from materials packed in open cargo transport units in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. (2) Hazardous materials stowed as breakbulk cargo must be segregated from materials packed in closed cargo transport units in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except that: (i) Where “away from” is required, no segregation between packages and the closed cargo transport units is required; and (ii) Where “separated from” is required, the segregation between the packages and the closed cargo transport units may be the same as for “away from”. (f) Segregation of cargo transport units on board container vessels: (1) Except for hatchless container ships, this paragraph applies to segregation of cargo transport units that are carried on board container vessels, or on other types of vessels, provided these cargo spaces are properly fitted for permanent stowage of containers during transport. (2) For container vessels which have cargo spaces used for breakbulk cargo or any other method of stowage, the appropriate paragraph of this section applies to the relevant cargo space. (3) Segregation Table. Table § 176.83(f) sets forth the general requirements for segregation between cargo transport units on board container vessels. (4) In table § 176.83(f), a container space means a distance of not less than 6 m (20 feet) fore and aft or not less than 2.5 m (8 feet) athwartship. (g) Segregation of cargo transport units on board trailerships and trainships: (1) The requirements of this paragraph apply to the segregation of cargo transport units which are carried on board trailerships and trainships or in “roll-on/roll-off” cargo spaces. (2) For trailerships and trainships which have spaces suitable for breakbulk cargo, containers, or any other method of stowage, the appropriate paragraph of this section applies to the relevant cargo space. (3) Segregation Table. Table § 176.83(g) sets forth the general requirements for segregation between transport units on board trailerships and trainships. (h) Segregation on board barge carrying vessels: (1) The requirements of this section apply to the segregation in shipborne barges as well as to the segregation between shipborne barges carried on board vessels specially designed and equipped to carry such barges. (2) On barge-carrying vessels which incorporate other stowage spaces or any other method of stowage, barges containing hazardous materials must be segregated from hazardous materials not stowed in barges as prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (j) of this section. (i) Segregation in shipborne barges: Hazardous materials transported in shipborne barges must be segregated as prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. (j) Segregation between shipborne barges on barge-carrying vessels: (1) When a shipborne barge is loaded with two or more hazardous materials with different requirements for segregation, the most stringent applicable segregation requirement must be applied. (2) “Away from” and “separated from” require no segregation between shipborne barges. (3) For barge-carrying vessels with vertical holds, “Separated by a complete compartment or hold from” means that separate holds are required. On barge-carrying vessels having horizontal barge levels, separate barge levels are required and the barges may not be in the same vertical line. (4) “Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete compartment or hold from” means, for barge-carrying vessels with vertical holds, that separation by an intervening hold or engine room is required. On barge-carrying vessels having horizontal barge levels, separate barge levels and a longitudinal separation by at least two intervening barge spaces are required. (k) Segregation requirements for ferry vessels: A ferry vessel (when operating either as a passenger or cargo vessel) that cannot provide the separation required in this section may carry incompatible hazardous materials in separate transport vehicles if they are stowed to give the maximum possible separation. (l) Segregation of containers on board hatchless (open-top) container ships: (1) This paragraph applies to the segregation of cargo transport units that are transported on board hatchless container ships provided that the cargo spaces are properly fitted to give permanent stowage of the cargo transport units during transport. (2) For container ships that have both hatchless container spaces and other spaces suitable for breakbulk cargo, conventional container stowage, or any other method of stowage, the appropriate requirements of this section apply to the relevant cargo space. (3) Segregation Table. Table § 176.83(l)(3) sets forth the general requirements for segregation of cargo transport units on board hatchless container ships. (4) In Table § 176.83(l)(3), a container space means a distance of not less than 6 m (20 feet) fore and aft or not less than 2.5 m (8 feet) athwartship. (m) Provisions for segregation groups: (1) For the purpose of segregation, materials having certain similar chemical properties have been grouped together in segregation groups. The segregation groups (such as “acids”, “chlorates”, “permanganates”) and the entries allocated to each of these groups include the substances identified in section 3.1.4 of the IMDG Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). When column (10B) of the § 172.101 Table refers to a numbered stowage provision set forth in § 176.84(b) such as “Stow ‘away from’ acids”, that particular stowage/segregation requirement applies to all the materials allocated to the respective segregation group. (2) Not all hazardous materials falling within a segregation group are listed by name in the regulations. These materials are shipped under “n.o.s.” entries. Although these “n.o.s.” entries are not listed themselves in the above groups, the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation must decide whether allocation under a segregation group is appropriate. (3) The segregation groups described above do not address materials that fall outside the classification criteria of the hazardous materials regulations, although it is recognized that some non-hazardous materials have certain chemical properties similar to hazardous materials listed in the segregation groups. A person who offers a hazardous material for transportation or the person responsible for packing the materials into a cargo transport unit who does have knowledge of the chemical properties of such non-hazardous materials may identify a relevant segregation group and apply the segregation requirements for that segregation group.

(a) Engine stopped. Unless the engine of a cargo tank motor vehicle is to be used for the operation of a pump, Class 3 material may not be loaded into, or on, or unloaded from any cargo tank motor vehicle while the engine is running. The diesel engine of a cargo tank motor vehicle may be left running during the loading and unloading of a Class 3 material if the ambient atmospheric temperature is at or below −12 °C (10 °F). (b) Bonding and grounding containers other than cargo tanks prior to and during transfer of lading. For containers which are not in metallic contact with each other, either metallic bonds or ground conductors shall be provided for the neutralization of possible static charges prior to and during transfers of Class 3 (flammable liquid) materials between such containers. Such bonding shall be made by first connecting an electric conductor to the container to be filled and subsequently connecting the conductor to the container from which the liquid is to come, and not in any other order. To provide against ignition of vapors by discharge of static electricity, the latter connection shall be made at a point well removed from the opening from which the Class 3 (flammable liquid) material is to be discharged. (c) Bonding and grounding cargo tanks before and during transfer of lading. (1) When a cargo tank is loaded through an open filling hole, one end of a bond wire shall be connected to the stationary system piping or integrally connected steel framing, and the other end to the shell of the cargo tank to provide a continuous electrical connection. (If bonding is to the framing, it is essential that piping and framing be electrically interconnected.) This connection must be made before any filling hole is opened, and must remain in place until after the last filling hole has been closed. Additional bond wires are not needed around All-Metal flexible or swivel joints, but are required for nonmetallic flexible connections in the stationary system piping. When a cargo tank is unloaded by a suction-piping system through an open filling hole of the cargo tank, electrical continuity shall be maintained from cargo tank to receiving tank. (2) When a cargo tank is loaded or unloaded through a vapor-tight (not open hole) top or bottom connection, so that there is no release of vapor at a point where a spark could occur, bonding or grounding is not required. Contact of the closed connection must be made before flow starts and must not be broken until after the flow is completed. (3) Bonding or grounding is not required when a cargo tank is unloaded through a nonvapor-tight connection into a stationary tank provided the metallic filling connection is maintained in contact with the filling hole.
